\section{Introduction} \label{sec:introduction}

%________________________________________________________________
\section{Target selection, observation, reduction} \label{sec:selection_observation_reduction}

The selection was based on 2MASS \citep{Skrutskie2006} magnitudes and due to their brightness, almost all stars of the GALAH observations have well measured 5D information from \Gaia \citep{Brown2018, Lindegren2018}. An overview of the astro- and photometric information of the observed spectra can be found in Fig.~\ref{fig:plot_parallax_quality_and_cmds}

Panel a) shows the unprecedented parallax ($\varpi$) uncertainty provided by \Gaia DR2 with 702945 (91\%) spectra below 15\% (blue) and 71204 (9\%) spectra with uncertainties above 15\% (red, truncated). Panel b) shows a color-magnitude diagram as observed with the optical \Gaia passbands, whereas panel c) shows a color-magnitude diagram as observed with the infra-red 2MASS passbands. \SB{Note that not all of these stars are included in GALAH DR3}.}

\section{Data analysis} \label{sec:analysis}

%________________________________________________________________
\subsection{Analysis flow and changes with respect to DR2} \label{sec:analysis_flow}

\begin{itemize}
\item SME only, no use of \textit{The Cannon} in this DR
\item Lay this out and motivate that by a figure, which shows 3 panels in the top for DR2 (Teff-logg, [Fe/H]-[alpha/Fe], [Fe/H]-A(Li)) and DR3 in the bottom
\item SME536, including changes as introduced by \citet{Piskunov2017}, but also with additional differences in the use of SME
\item using fundamental relation of surface gravity $\log g$ with available, non-spectroscopic information ($\varpi$ and $K_S$)
\item Workflow: 
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Estimate stellar parameters (\teff, \feh, \vbroad, \vrad from spectra, \logg via fundamental relation, \vmic via empirical relation)
	\item Validation of stellar parameters (see Sec.\ref{sec:validation_sp}), leading to an adjustment of the estimated atmospheric [Fe/H] (\textsc{sme.feh}) by adding $0.1\,\mathrm{dex}$\footnote{NB: This is not the final [Fe/H] as reported in this data release, but a pseudo iron abundance, estimated from H, Sc, Ti, and Fe lines.}
	\item Keep stellar parameters fixed and then estimate A(X) for element X. These can be done combined (write elements for which that was done) or on a line-by-line basis (write elements for which that was done).
\end{enumerate}
\end{itemize}

%________________________________________________________________
\subsection{Validation of stellar parameters} \label{sec:validation_sp}

To assess the quality of the stellar parameters, we resort to the commonly used comparison samples for accuracy, that is the GBS and the stars with asteroseismic information. For the precision assessment we use the internal uncertainty estimates and repeat observations of the same stars.  We calculate the final stellar parameter errors for a given parameter $X$ via 
\begin{equation}
e_\text{final}^2 (X) = e_\text{accuracy}^2(X) + e_\text{fit}^2(X) + e_\text{repeats}^2(X). \label{eq:final_error}
\end{equation}

We note that $e_\text{fit}^2(X)$ and $e_\text{repeats}^2(X)$ are typically expected to be the same tracer of precision and hence only their maximum value should be used, that is
\begin{equation}
e_\text{final}^2 (X) = e_\text{accuracy}^2(X) + \text{max} \left(e_\text{fit}^2(X) + e_\text{repeats}^2(X) \right).
\end{equation}

We elaborate on the choice of error combination when we assess the precision of the stellar parameters.

\subsection{The complexity and importance of flagging (and using them)}

\subsubsection{Flagging of stellar parameters}

\subsubsection{Flagging of element abundances}

We expect less trends without the influence of the training set selection or data-model flexibilities, but we still expect trends for several reasons:
\begin{itemize}
\item Given the model- and setup-imperfections, excluding \logg as a free fitting parameter might lead to systematic trends. This can be the case for those stars where the true \logg of the star and our estimated \logg differ significantly (e.g. binaries where the (unidentified) second component is contributing to the flux of the system) or the synthetic spectrum with the true \logg does not match the observation (e.g. due to shortcomings of the 1D model atmospheres and synthesis).
\item For stars with more lines, our pipeline will perform worse several ways. Firstly, estimating the continuum will be less reliable. Secondly, we will run into issues of strong blending, where our estimate is limited to how close the synthesis of the blending lines is to the true observation. If for example a star has scaled solar abundances, our estimates of the element abundances will still be good even for blended cases. If the compositions differs, and the line that we want to measure is blended by a line of a significantly over- or under-abundant element (relative to scaled-solar), our measurement might be corrupted. We try to limit this by performing a blending test, but setting the limit on how much blending is still acceptable is both non-trivial but also hard to flag during post-processing.
\item Due to time/computation restrictions, we were running several elements in a combined rather than line-by-line basis, which can decrease the precision as outlined in Sec.~\ref{sec:analysis_flow}, although we have tried to ensure that the abundance zero points of the individual lines were similar for those elements that were run with the combined setup.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Expect the (un-)expected, but be cautious: Analysis shortcoming or physical correlation?}

\section{Catalogs included in this release}  \label{sec:catalogs}

The third Data Release of GALAH is accompanied by two value-added-catalogs and we explain them in this section. One value-added-catalog includes extended abundance measurement information, another one stellar ages as well as masses and a third one kinematic as well as dynamic information for each star.
