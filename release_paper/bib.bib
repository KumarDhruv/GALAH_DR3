	Abstract = {{Many stellar models present difficulties in reproducing basic
observational relations of very low mass stars (VLMS), including the
mass-radius relation and the optical colour-magnitudes of cool dwarfs.
Here, we improve PARSEC (PAdova-TRieste Stellar Evolution Code) models
on these points. We implement the T- {$\tau$} relations from PHOENIX
BT-Settl model atmospheres as the outer boundary conditions in the
PARSEC code, finding that this change alone reduces the discrepancy in
the mass-radius relation from 8 to 5 per cent. We compare the models
with multiband photometry of clusters Praesepe and M67, showing that the
use of T- {$\tau$} relations clearly improves the description of the
optical colours and magnitudes. But anyway, using both Kurucz and
PHOENIX model spectra, model colours are still systematically fainter
and bluer than the observations. We then apply a shift to the above T-
{$\tau$} relations, increasing from 0 at T$_{eff}$ = 4730 K to
{\tilde}14 per cent at T$_{eff}$ = 3160 K, to reproduce the
observed mass-radius relation of dwarf stars. Taking this experiment as
a calibration of the T- {$\tau$} relations, we can reproduce the optical
and near-infrared colour-magnitude diagrams of low-mass stars in the old
metal-poor globular clusters NGC 6397 and 47 Tuc, and in the
intermediate-age and young solar-metallicity open clusters M67 and
Praesepe. Thus, we extend PARSEC models using this calibration,
providing VLMS models more suitable for the lower main-sequence stars
over a wide range of metallicities and wavelengths. Both sets of models
are available on PARSEC webpage.

@article{Chen2015,
	Abstract = {{We complement the PARSEC data base of stellar evolutionary tracks with
new models of massive stars, from the pre-main-sequence phase to the
central carbon ignition. We consider a broad range of metallicities,
0.0001 {\le} Z {\le} 0.04 and initial masses up to M$_{ini}$ = 350
M$_{&sun;}$. The main difference with respect to our previous
models of massive stars is the adoption of a recent formalizm accounting
for the mass-loss enhancement when the ratio of the stellar to the
Eddington luminosity, {$\Gamma$}$_{e}$, approaches unity. With this
new formalizm, the models are able to reproduce the Humphreys-Davidson
limit observed in the Galactic and Large Magellanic Cloud
colour-magnitude diagrams, without an ad hoc mass-loss enhancement. We
also follow the predictions of recent wind models indicating that the
metallicity dependence of the mass-loss rates becomes shallower when
{$\Gamma$}$_{e}$ approaches unity. We thus find that the more massive
stars may suffer from substantial mass-loss even at low metallicity. We
also predict that the Humphreys-Davidson limit should become brighter at
decreasing metallicity. We supplement the evolutionary tracks with new
tables of theoretical bolometric corrections, useful to compare tracks
and isochrones with the observations. For this purpose, we homogenize
existing stellar atmosphere libraries of hot and cool stars (Potsdam
Wolf-Rayet, ATLAS9 and PHOENIX) and we add, where needed, new atmosphere
models computed with WM-BASIC. The mass, age and metallicity grids are
fully adequate to perform detailed investigations of the properties of
very young stellar systems, both in local and distant galaxies. The new
tracks supersede the previous old PADOVA models of massive stars.

@article{Tang2014,
	Abstract = {{We extend the PARSEC library of stellar evolutionary tracks by computing
new models of massive stars, from 14 to 350 M$_{&sun;}$. The input
physics is the same used in the PARSEC V1.1 version, but for the
mass-loss rate from considering the most recent updates in the
literature. We focus on low metallicity, Z = 0.001 and Z = 0.004, for
which the metal-poor dwarf irregular star-forming galaxies, Sextans A,
the Wolf-Lundmark-Melotte galaxy and NGC 6822, provide simple but
powerful workbenches. The models reproduce fairly well the observed
colour-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) but the stellar colour distributions
indicate that the predicted blue loop is not hot enough in models with a
canonical extent of overshooting. In the framework of a mild extended
mixing during central hydrogen burning, the only way to reconcile the
discrepancy is to enhance the overshooting at the base of the convective
envelope (EO) during the first dredge-up. The mixing scales required to
reproduce the observed loops, EO = 2H$_{P}$ or EO =
4H$_{P}$, are definitely larger than those derived from, e.g. the
observed location of the red-giant-branch bump in low mass stars. This
effect, if confirmed, would imply a strong dependence of the mixing
scale below the formal Schwarzschild border, on the stellar mass or
luminosity. Reproducing the features of the observed CMDs with standard
values of envelope overshooting would require a metallicity
significantly lower than the values measured in these galaxies. Other
quantities, such as the star formation rate and the initial mass
function, are only slightly sensitive to this effect. Future
investigations will consider other metallicities and different mixing
schemes.

	Abstract = {{We present the updated version of the code used to compute stellar
evolutionary tracks in Padova. It is the result of a thorough revision
of the major input physics, together with the inclusion of the pre-main
sequence phase, not present in our previous releases of stellar models.
Another innovative aspect is the possibility of promptly generating
accurate opacity tables fully consistent with any selected initial
chemical composition, by coupling the Opacity Project At Livermore
(OPAL) data at high temperatures to the molecular opacities computed
with our {\ae}SOPUS code. In this work, we present extended sets of
stellar evolutionary models for various initial chemical compositions,
while other sets with different metallicities and/or different
distributions of heavy elements are being computed. For the present
release of models, we adopt the solar distribution of heavy elements
from the recent revision by Caffau et al., corresponding to a Sun's
metallicity Z {\sime} 0.0152. From all computed sets of stellar tracks,
we also derive isochrones in several photometric systems. The aim is to
provide the community with the basic tools to model star clusters and
galaxies by means of population synthesis techniques.

	Abstract = {{Using a large sample of main sequence stars with 7D measurements
supplied by Gaia and SDSS, we study the kinematic properties of the
local (within {\tilde}10 kpc from the Sun) stellar halo. We demonstrate
that the halo's velocity ellipsoid evolves strongly with metallicity. At
the low-[Fe/H] end, the orbital anisotropy (the amount of motion in the
radial direction compared with the tangential one) is mildly radial,
with 0.2 $\lt${$\beta$}$\lt$ 0.4. For stars with [Fe/H] $\gt$ -1.7, however,
we measure extreme values of {$\beta$}{\tilde} 0.9. Across the metallicity
range considered, namely-3 $\lt$ [Fe/H] $\lt$ -1, the stellar halo's spin
is minimal, at the level of 20$\lt$ $\backslash$bar$\{$v$\}$\_$\{${\thetas} $\}$(kms\^{}$\{$-1$\}$) $\lt$
30. Using a suite of cosmological zoom-in simulations of halo formation,
we deduce that the observed acute anisotropy is inconsistent with the
continuous accretion of dwarf satellites. Instead, we argue, the stellar
debris in the inner halo was deposited in a major accretion event by a
satellite with M$_{vir}$ $\gt$ 10$^{10}$M$_{&sun;}$
around the epoch of the Galactic disc formation, between 8 and 11 Gyr
ago. The radical halo anisotropy is the result of the dramatic
radialization of the massive progenitor's orbit, amplified by the action
of the growing disc.

	Abstract = {{Using the astrometry from the ESA's Gaia mission, previous works have
shown that the Milky Way stellar halo is dominated by metal-rich stars
on highly eccentric orbits. To shed light on the nature of this
prominent halo component, we have analysed 28 Galaxy analogues in the
Auriga suite of cosmological hydrodynamics zoom-in simulations. Some
three quarters of the Auriga galaxies contain significant components
with high radial velocity anisotropy, beta $\gt$ 0.6. However, only in
one third of the hosts do the high-beta stars contribute significantly
to the accreted stellar halo overall, similar to what is observed in the
Milky Way. For this particular subset we reveal the origin of the
dominant stellar halo component with high metallicity, [Fe/H]\~{}-1, and
high orbital anisotropy, beta$\gt$0.8, by tracing their stars back to the
epoch of accretion. It appears that, typically, these stars come from a
single dwarf galaxy with a stellar mass of order of 10\^{}9-10\^{}10 Msol that
merged around 6-10 Gyr ago, causing a sharp increase in the halo mass.
Our study therefore establishes a firm link between the excess of
radially anisotropic stellar debris in the Milky Way halo and an ancient
head-on collision between the young Milky Way and a massive dwarf galaxy

common accretion history. We devise a method to identify halo
substructures based on their clustering in action space, using
metallicity as a secondary check. This is validated against smooth
models and numerical constructed stellar haloes from the Aquarius
simulations. We identify 21 substructures in the SDSS-Gaia catalogue,
including seven high-significance, high-energy and retrograde ones. We
investigate whether the retrograde substructures may be material
stripped off the atypical globular cluster {$\omega$} Centauri. Using a
simple model of the accretion of the progenitor of the {$\omega$} Centauri,
we tentatively argue for the possible association of up to five of our
new substructures (labelled Rg1, Rg3, Rg4, Rg6 and Rg7) with this event.
This sets a minimum mass of 5 {\times} 10$^{8}$ M$_{&sun;}$
for the progenitor, so as to bring {$\omega$} Centauri to its current
location in action-energy space. Our proposal can be tested by
high-resolution spectroscopy of the candidates to look for the unusual
abundance patterns possessed by {$\omega$} Centauri stars.

using {\tilde}60000 stars with full phase space coordinates extracted from

function of metallicity in a realistic axisymmetric potential for the
Milky Way Galaxy. The metal-rich population is more distended toward

prograde rotation ($\lt$ $\{$v$\}$$_{phi }$$\gt$ {\ap} 25 $\{$km$\}$

with axis ratio q {\ap} 0.6-0.7. The metal-poor population is more
evenly distributed in all three actions. It has larger prograde rotation
($\lt$ $\{$v$\}$$_{phi }$$\gt$ {\ap} 50 $\{$km$\}$ $\{$$\{$$\{$s$\}$$\}$$\}$$^{-1}$), a
mild radial anisotropy, and a roundish morphology (q {\ap} 0.9). We
identify two further components of the halo in action space. There is a
high-energy, retrograde component that is only present in the metal-rich
stars. This is suggestive of an origin in a retrograde encounter,
possibly the one that created the stripped dwarf galaxy nucleus,
{$\omega$}Centauri. Also visible as a distinct entity in action space is a
resonant component, which is flattened and prograde. It extends over a
range of metallicities down to [Fe/H] {\ap} -3. It has a net
outward radial velocity $\lt$ $\{$v$\}$$_{R}$$\gt$ {\ap} 12 $\{$km$\}$
$\{$$\{$$\{$s$\}$$\}$$\}$$^{-1}$ within the solar circle at | z| $\lt$ 3.5 $\{$kpc$\}$. The
existence of resonant stars at such extremely low metallicities has not

(GCs) to infer the formation and assembly history of the Milky Way (MW),
culminating in the reconstruction of its merger tree. Based on a
quantitative comparison of the Galactic GC population to the 25
cosmological zoom-in simulations of MW-mass galaxies in the E-MOSAICS
project, which self-consistently model the formation and evolution of GC
populations in a cosmological context, we find that the MW assembled
quickly for its mass, reaching $\{$25, 50$\}$\% of its present-day halo mass
already at z = $\{$3, 1.5$\}$ and half of its present-day stellar mass at z =
1.2. We reconstruct the MW's merger tree from its GC age-metallicity
distribution, inferring the number of mergers as a function of mass
ratio and redshift. These statistics place the MW's assembly rate among
the 72th-94th percentile of the E-MOSAICS galaxies, whereas its
integrated properties (e.g. number of mergers, halo concentration) match
the median of the simulations. We conclude that the MW has experienced
no major mergers (mass ratios $\gt$1:4) since z {\tilde} 4, sharpening
previous limits of z {\tilde} 2. We identify three massive satellite
progenitors and constrain their mass growth and enrichment histories.
Two are proposed to correspond to Sagittarius (few
10$^{8}$M$_{&sun;}$) and Canis Major ({\tilde}10$^{9}$
M$_{&sun;}$). The third satellite has no known associated relic
and was likely accreted between z = 0.6-1.3. We name this enigmatic
galaxy Kraken and propose that it is the most massive satellite
(M$_{*}$ {\tilde} 2 {\times} 10$^{9}$ M$_{&sun;}$) ever
accreted by the MW. We predict that {\tilde}40\% of the Galactic GCs
formed ex-situ (in galaxies with masses M$_{*}$ = 2 {\times}

	Abstract = {{We report the discovery of a group of apparently young CoRoT red-giant
stars exhibiting enhanced [{$\alpha$}/Fe] abundance ratios (as determined
from APOGEE spectra) with respect to solar values. Their existence is
not explained bystandard chemical evolution models of the Milky Way, and
shows that the chemical-enrichment history of the Galactic disc is more
complex. We find similar stars in previously published samples for which
isochrone-ages could be reliably obtained, although in smaller relative
numbers. This might explain why these stars have not previously received
attention. The young [{$\alpha$}/Fe]-rich stars are much more numerous in
the CoRoT-APOGEE (CoRoGEE) inner-field sample than in any other
high-resolution sample available at present because only CoRoGEE can
explore the inner-disc regions and provide ages for its field stars. The
kinematic properties of the young [{$\alpha$}/Fe]-rich stars are not
clearly thick-disc like, despite their rather large distances from the
Galactic mid-plane. Our tentative interpretation of these and previous
intriguing observations in the Milky Way is that these stars were formed
close to the end of the Galactic bar, near corotation - a region where
gas can be kept inert for longer times than in other regions that are
more frequently shocked by the passage of spiral arms. Moreover, this is
where the mass return from older inner-disc stellar generations is
expected to be highest (according to an inside-out disc-formation
scenario), which additionally dilutes the in-situ gas. Other
possibilities to explain these observations (e.g., a recent
gas-accretion event) are also discussed.

below 4 Gyr. We examine the effect of modifications in the standard
seismic scaling relations, as well as the effect of very low helium

@article{Bensby2013,
	Abstract = {{Based on high-resolution spectra obtained during gravitational
microlensing events we present a detailed elemental abundance analysis
of 32 dwarf and subgiant stars in the Galactic bulge. Combined with the
sample of 26 stars from the previous papers in this series, we now have
58 microlensed bulge dwarfs and subgiants that have been homogeneously
analysed. The main characteristics of the sample and the findings that
can be drawn are: (i) the metallicity distribution (MDF) is wide and
spans all metallicities between [Fe/H] = -1.9 to +0.6; (ii) the dip in
the MDF around solar metallicity that was apparent in our previous
analysis of a smaller sample (26 microlensed stars) is no longer
evident; instead it has a complex structure and indications of multiple
components are starting to emerge. A tentative interpretation is that
there could be different stellar populations at interplay, each with a
different scale height: the thin disk, the thick disk, and a bar
population; (iii) the stars with [Fe/H] {\lsim} -0.1 are old with ages
between 10 and 12 Gyr; (iv) the metal-rich stars with [Fe/H] {\gsim} -0.1
show a wide variety of ages, ranging from 2 to 12 Gyr with a
distribution that has a dominant peak around 4-5 Gyr and a tail towards
higher ages; (v) there are indications in the [{$\alpha$}/Fe]-[Fe/H]
abundance trends that the ``knee'' occurs around [Fe/H] = -0.3to -0.2,
which is a slightly higher metallicity as compared to the ``knee'' for the
local thick disk. This suggests that the chemical enrichment of the
metal-poor bulge has been somewhat faster than what is observed for the
local thick disk. The results from the microlensed bulge dwarf stars in
combination with other findings in the literature, in particular the
evidence that the bulge has cylindrical rotation, indicate that the
Milky Way could be an almost pure disk galaxy. The bulge would then just
be a conglomerate of the other Galactic stellar populations (thin disk,
thick disk, halo, and ...?), residing together in the central parts of
the Galaxy, influenced by the Galactic bar.

older; (3) several episodes of significant star formation in the bulge
has been identified: 3, 6, 8, and 11 Gyr ago; (4) tentatively the ``knee''
in the {$\alpha$}-element abundance trends of the sub-solar metallicity
bulge is located at a slightly higher [Fe/H] than in the local thick
disk. These findings show that the Galactic bulge has complex age and
abundance properties that appear to be tightly connected to the main
Galactic stellar populations. In particular, the peaks in the
metallicity distribution, the star formation episodes, and the abundance
trends, show similarities with the properties of the Galactic thin and
thick disks. At the same time, the star formation rate appears to have
been slightly faster in the bulge than in the local thick disk, which
most likely is an indication of the denser stellar environment closer to
the Galactic centre. There are also additional components not seen
outside the bulge region, and that most likely can be associated with
the Galactic bar. Our results strengthen the observational evidence that
support the idea of a secular origin for the Galactic bulge, formed out
of the other main Galactic stellar populations present in the central
regions of our Galaxy. Additionally, our analysis of this enlarged
sample suggests that the (V-I)$_{0}$ colour of the bulge red clump
should be revised to 1.09.

	Abstract = {{A deep understanding of the Milky Way galaxy, its formation and
evolution requires observations of large numbers of stars. Stellar
photometry provides an economical method to obtain intrinsic stellar
parameters. With the addition of distance information -- a prospect made
real for more than a billion stars with the second Gaia data release --
deriving reliable ages from photometry is a possibility. We developed a
Bayesian method to generate 2D probability maps of a star's age and
metallicity from photometry and parallax using isochrones. Our synthetic
tests show that colours in the optical or near-infrared cannot by
themselves provide unique ages and metallicities due to strong
degeneracy between the two parameters. Including a near-UV passband
enables us to break this degeneracy for many types of stars. It is
possible to find well-constrained ages and metallicities for turn-off
and sub-giant stars with colours including a U band and a parallax with
an uncertainty less than approximately 20\%. Metallicities alone are
possible for the main sequence and giant branch. We attempted to recover
ages and metallicities from real data, using the Gaia benchmark stars
and the old open cluster NGC 188. This revealed significant limitations
in the stellar isochrones. The ages of the cluster stars varied with
evolutionary stage, such that turn-off ages were discrepant with those
on the sub-giant branch and metallicities varied significantly
throughout the HR diagram. Most importantly, the parameters varied
appreciably depending on which colour combinations were used in the
derivation. We conclude that there exists a noticeable mismatch between
the photometry from isochrones and those from observations. Our results
here are a warning to those applying isochrone ages indiscriminately.
Further efforts to improve the models will result in significant
advances in our ability to study the Galaxy.

	Abstract = {{In the age of high-resolution spectroscopic stellar surveys of the Milky
Way, the number of stars with detailed abundances of multiple elements
is rapidly increasing. These elemental abundances are directly
influenced by the evolutionary history of the Galaxy, but this can be
difficult to interpret without an absolute timeline of the abundance
enrichment. We present age-abundance trends for [M/H], [{$\alpha$}/M], and
17 individual elements using a sample of 721 solar neighbourhood
Hipparcos red giant stars observed by Apache Point Observatory Galactic
Evolution Experiment. These age trends are determined through a Bayesian
hierarchical modelling method presented by Feuillet et al. We confirm
that the [{$\alpha$}/M]-age relation in the solar neighbourhood is steep
and relatively narrow (0.20 dex age dispersion), as are the [O/M]-age
and [Mg/M]-age relations. The age trend of [C/N] is steep and smooth,
consistent with stellar evolution. The [M/H]-age relation has a mean age
dispersion of 0.28 dex and a complex overall structure. The oldest stars
in our sample are those with the lowest and highest metallicities, while
the youngest stars are those with solar metallicity. These results
provide strong constraints on theoretical models of Galactic chemical
evolution (GCE). We compare them to the predictions of one-zone GCE
models and multizone mixtures, both analytic and numerical. These
comparisons support the hypothesis that the solar neighbourhood is
composed of stars born at a range of Galactocentric radii, and that the
most metal-rich stars likely migrated from a region with earlier and
more rapid star formation such as the inner Galaxy.

data-driven approach is used to search for corresponding templates in
the pool of 434,215 measured dwarf spectra in the survey. It enables a
model-free search for best-matching spectral templates for all stars,
including M dwarfs with strong molecular absorption bands. 3147 stars

are used to investigate the possibility of searching for young stars
above the main sequence based merely on their parallaxes and broad-band
photometry. Selection of young stars above the main sequence is highly
effective for M dwarfs, moderately effective for K dwarfs and
ineffective for G dwarfs. Using a combination of the Lithium information

	Abstract = {{Context: The majority of galactic chemical evolution models assumes the
        instantaneous mixing approximation (IMA). This assumption is
        probably not realistic, as indicated by the existence of
        chemical inhomogeneities, although current chemical evolution
        models of the Milky Way can reproduce the majority of the
        observational constraints under the IMA. <BR />Aims: The aim of
        this paper is to test whether relaxing this approximation in a
        detailed chemical evolution model can improve or worsen the
        agreement with observations. To do that, we investigated two
        possible causes for relaxing of the instantaneous mixing: i) the
        {\textquotedblleft}galactic fountain time delay
        effect{\textquotedblright} and ii) the {\textquotedblleft}metal
        cooling time delay effect{\textquotedblright}. <BR />Methods: We
        considered various galactic fountain time delays for the
        chemical enrichment from massive stars. We then tested a time
        delay in the enrichment from stars of all masses due to gas
        cooling in the range 0.5-1 Gyr. <BR />Results: We found that the
        effect of galactic fountains is negligible if an average time
        delay of 0.1 Gyr, as suggested in a previous paper, is assumed.
        Longer time delays produce differences in the results but they
        are not realistic. We also found that the O abundance gradient
        in the disk is not affected by galactic fountains. The metal
        cooling time delays produce strong effects on the evolution of
        the chemical abundances only if we adopt stellar yields
        depending on metallicity. If, instead, the yields computed for
        the solar chemical composition are adopted, negligible effects
        are produced, as in the case of the galactic fountain delay. <BR
        />Conclusions: The relaxation of the IMA by means of the
        galactic fountain model, where the delay is considered only for
        massive stars and only in the disk, does not affect the chemical
        evolution results. The combination of metal dependent yields and
        time delay in the chemical enrichment from all stars starting
        from the halo phase, instead, produces results at variance with
        observations.}},

@article{Chiappini2001,
	Abstract = {{In this paper we adopt a chemical evolution model, which is an improved
        version of the Chiappini, Matteucci, \&amp; Gratton model,
        assuming two main accretion episodes for the formation of the
        Galaxy, the first forming the halo and bulge in a short
        timescale and the second one forming the thin disk, with a
        timescale that is an increasing function of the Galactocentric
        distance (being of the order of 7 Gyrs at the solar
        neighborhood). The present model takes into account in more
        detail than previously the halo density distribution and
        explores the effects of a threshold density in the star
        formation process during both the halo and disk phases. The
        model also includes the most recent nucleosynthesis
        prescriptions concerning supernovae of all types, novae, and
        single stars dying as white dwarfs. In the comparison between
        model predictions and available data, we have focused our
        attention on abundance gradients as well as gas, stellar, and
        star formation rate distributions along the disk, since this
        kind of model has already proven to be quite successful in
        reproducing the solar neighborhood characteristics. We suggest
        that the mechanism for the formation of the halo leaves
        detectable imprints on the chemical properties of the outer
        regions of the disk, whereas the evolution of the halo and the
        inner disk are almost completely disentangled. This is due to
        the fact that the halo and disk densities are comparable at
        large Galactocentric distances and therefore the gas lost from
        the halo can substantially contribute to building up the outer
        disk. We also show that the existence of a threshold density for
        the star formation rate, both in the halo and disk phase, is
        necessary to reproduce the majority of observational data in the
        solar vicinity and in the whole disk. In particular, a threshold
        in the star formation implies the occurrence of a gap in the
        star formation at the halo-disk transition phase, in agreement
        with recent data. We conclude that a relatively short halo
        formation timescale (\textasciitilde=0.8 Gyr), in agreement with
        recent estimates for the age differences among Galactic globular
        clusters, coupled with an ``inside-out'' formation of the
        Galactic disk, where the innermost regions are assumed to have
        formed much faster than the outermost ones, represents, at the
        moment, the most likely explanation for the formation of the
        Milky Way. This scenario allows us to predict abundance
        gradients and other radial properties of the Galactic disk in
        very good agreement with observations. Moreover, as a
        consequence of the adopted ``inside-out'' scenario for the disk,
        we predict that the abundance gradients along the Galactic disk
        must have increased with time and that the average
        \&lt;[{\ensuremath{\alpha}}/Fe]\&gt; ratios in stars (halo plus
        disk) slightly decrease going from 4 to 10 kpcs from the
        Galactic center. We also show that the same ratios increase
        substantially toward the outermost disk regions and the expected
        scatter in the stellar ages decreases, because the outermost
        regions are dominated by halo stars. More observations at large
        Galactocentric distances are needed to test these predictions.}},

        nucleosynthesis in stars is well understood by now, large
        uncertainties still affect model predictions. This is especially
        true for the majority of the iron-peak elements, but also for
        much more abundant species such as carbon and nitrogen. The main
        causes of the mismatch we find among the outputs of different
        models assuming different stellar yields and among model
        predictions and observations are (i) the adopted location of the
        mass cut in models of type II supernova explosions; (ii) the
        adopted strength and extent of hot bottom burning in models of
        asymptotic giant branch stars; (iii) the neglection of the
        effects of rotation on the chemical composition of the stellar
        surfaces; (iv) the adopted rates of mass loss and of (v) nuclear
        reactions; and (vi) the different treatments of convection. <BR
        /> Conclusions: Our results suggest that it is mandatory to
        include processes such as hot bottom burning in intermediate-
        mass stars and rotation in stars of all masses in accurate
        studies of stellar evolution and nucleosynthesis. In spite of
        their importance, both these processes still have to be better
        understood and characterized. As for massive stars, presupernova
        models computed with mass loss and rotation are available in the
        literature, but they still wait for a self-consistent coupling
        with the results of explosive nucleosynthesis computations.}},

related to the calibration of the effective temperatures (DR13), surface
gravity (DR13 and DR14), and C and N abundances for dwarfs (DR13 and

technique, The Cannon, are included in DR14 and compare those with
results from the APOGEE Stellar Parameters and Chemical Abundances
Pipeline. We describe how using The Cannon in a mode that restricts the
abundance analysis of each element to regions of the spectrum with known
features from that element leads to Cannon abundances can lead to
significantly different results for some elements than when all regions
of the spectrum are used to derive abundances.

@article{Amarsi2018,
	Abstract = {{Hydrogen Balmer lines are commonly used as spectroscopic effective
temperature diagnostics of late-type stars. However, reliable inferences
require accurate model spectra, and the absolute accuracy of classical
methods that are based on one-dimensional (1D) hydrostatic model
atmospheres and local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) is still unclear.
To investigate this, we carry out 3D non-LTE calculations for the Balmer
lines, performed, for the first time, over an extensive grid of 3D
hydrodynamic STAGGER model atmospheres. For H{$\alpha$}, H{$\beta$}, and
H{$\gamma$} we find significant 1D non-LTE versus 3D non-LTE differences
(3D effects): the outer wings tend to be stronger in 3D models,
particularly for H{$\gamma$}, while the inner wings can be weaker in 3D
models, particularly for H{$\alpha$}. For H{$\alpha$}, we also find
significant 3D LTE versus 3D non-LTE differences (non-LTE effects): in
warmer stars (T$_{eff}$ {\ap} 6500 K) the inner wings tend to be
weaker in non-LTE models, while at lower effective temperatures
(T$_{eff}$ {\ap} 4500 K) the inner wings can be stronger in non-LTE
models; the non-LTE effects are more severe at lower metallicities. We
test our 3D non-LTE models against observations of well-studied
benchmark stars. For the Sun, we infer concordant effective temperatures
from H{$\alpha$}, H{$\beta$}, and H{$\gamma$}; however the value is too low by
around 50 K which could signal residual modelling shortcomings. For
other benchmark stars, our 3D non-LTE models generally reproduce the
effective temperatures to within 1{$\sigma$} uncertainties. For H{$\alpha$},
the absolute 3D effects and non-LTE effects can separately reach around
100 K, in terms of inferred effective temperatures. For metal-poor
turn-off stars, 1D LTE models of H{$\alpha$} can underestimate effective
temperatures by around 150 K. Our 3D non-LTE model spectra are publicly
available, and can be used for more reliable spectroscopic effective
temperature determinations.

	Abstract = {{Using GALAH (GALactic Archaeology with HERMES) survey data of nearby
stars, we look at how structure in the planar (u, v) velocity
distribution depends on metallicity and on viewing direction within the
Galaxy. In nearby stars with distance d {\lsim} 1 kpc, the Hercules
stream is most strongly seen in higher metallicity stars [Fe/H] $\gt$
0.2. The Hercules stream peak v value depends on viewed galactic
longitude, which we interpret as due to the gap between the stellar
stream and more circular orbits being associated with a specific angular
momentum value of about 1640 km s$^{-1}$ kpc. The association of
the gap with a particular angular momentum value supports a bar resonant
model for the Hercules stream. Moving groups previously identified in
Hipparcos(HIgh Precision Parallax COllecting Satellite) observations are
easiest to see in stars nearer than 250 pc, and their visibility and
peak velocities in the velocity distributions depends on both viewing
direction (galactic longitude and hemisphere) and metallicity. We infer
that there is fine structure in local velocity distributions that varies
over distances of a few hundred pc in the Galaxy.

	Abstract = {{Open cluster members are coeval and share the same initial bulk chemical
composition. Consequently, differences in surface abundances between
members of a cluster that are at different evolutionary stages can be
used to study the effects of mixing and internal chemical processing. We
carry out an abundance analysis of seven elements (Li, O, Na, Mg, Al,
Si, and Fe) in 66 stars belonging to the open cluster M67, based on high
resolution GALAH spectra, 1D MARCS model atmospheres, and non-local
thermodynamic equilibrium (non-LTE) radiative transfer. From the non-LTE
analysis, we find a typical star-to-star scatter in the abundance ratios
of around 0.05 dex. We find trends in the abundance ratios with
effective temperature, indicating systematic differences in the surface
abundances between turn-off and giant stars; these trends are more
pronounced when LTE is assumed. However, trends with effective
temperature remain significant for Al and Si also in non-LTE. Finally,
we compare the derived abundances with prediction from stellar evolution
models including effects of atomic diffusion. We find overall good
agreement for the abundance patterns of dwarfs and sub-giant stars, but
the abundances of cool giants are lower relative to less evolved stars
than predicted by the diffusion models, in particular for Mg.

spectrophotometric distance estimation framework for stars in the fifth

accurate than either determination in isolation - uncertainties are on
average two times smaller than for RAVE-only distances (three times
smaller for dwarfs), and 1.4 times smaller than TGAS parallax
uncertainties (two times smaller for giants). We are also able to
compare the estimates from spectrophotometry to those from Gaia, and use
this to assess the reliability of both catalogues and improve our
distance estimates. We find that the distances to the lowest log g stars
are, on average, overestimated and caution that they may not be
reliable. We also find that it is likely that the Gaia random
uncertainties are smaller than the reported values. As a by-product we
derive ages for the RAVE stars, many with relative uncertainties less
than 20 per cent. These results for 219 566 RAVE sources have been made

provides stellar parameters and abundances for up to 23 elements to the
community. Here we present the target selection, observation, data
reduction, and detailed explanation of how the spectra were analysed to
estimate stellar parameters and element abundances. For the stellar
analysis, we have used a multistep approach. We use the physics-driven
spectrum synthesis of Spectroscopy Made Easy (SME) to derive stellar
labels (T$_{eff}$, log g, [Fe/H], [X/Fe], v$_{mic}$, vsin i,
A\_$\{$K\_S$\}$) for a representative training set of stars. This information is
then propagated to the whole sample with the data-driven method of The
Cannon. Special care has been exercised in the spectral synthesis to
only consider spectral lines that have reliable atomic input data and
are little affected by blending lines. Departures from local
thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) are considered for several key elements,
including Li, O, Na, Mg, Al, Si, and Fe, using 1D MARCS stellar
atmosphere models. Validation tests including repeat observations, Gaia
benchmark stars, open and globular clusters, and K2 asteroseismic
targets lend confidence to our methods and results. Combining the GALAH

wide range of Galactic Archaeology studies, with unprecedented detail,

@article{Armillotta2018,
	Abstract = {Ongoing surveys are in the process of measuring the chemical abundances
in large numbers of stars, with the ultimate goal of reconstructing the
formation history of the Milky Way using abundances as tracers. However,
interpretation of these data requires that we understand the
relationship between stellar distributions in chemical and physical
space. We investigate this question by simulating the gravitational
collapse of a turbulent molecular cloud extracted from a galaxy-scale
simulation, seeded with chemical inhomogeneities with different initial
spatial scales. We follow the collapse from galactic scales down to
resolutions scales of {\ap}10$^{-3}$ pc, and find that, during this
process, turbulence mixes the metal patterns, reducing the abundance
scatter initially present in the gas by an amount that depends on the
initial scale of inhomogeneity of each metal field. However, we find
that regardless of the spatial structure of the metals at the onset of
collapse, the final stellar abundances are highly correlated only on
distances below a few pc. Consequently, the star formation process
defines a natural size scale of {\tilde}1 pc for chemically homogeneous
star clusters, suggesting that any clusters identified as homogeneous in
chemical space must have formed within {\tilde}1 pc of one another.
However, in order to distinguish different star clusters in chemical
space, observations across multiple elements are required, and the
elements that are likely to be most efficient at separating distinct

	Abstract = {{We analyse an N-body simulation of the interaction of a Sagittarius-like
dSph (Sgr) with the Milky Way (MW), looking for signatures which may be
attributed to the orbital history of Sgr in the stellar-phase space
volume around the Sun in light of the recent Gaia DR2 discoveries. In
this simulation, Sgr excites coupled oscillations in the vertical and
radial directions, a bar and bisymmetric spiral which quickly winds up
over the last Gyr of its evolution. The repeated impacts of Sgr with the
MW are qualitatively, and to a large degree quantitatively able to
reproduce many of the recently uncovered features in the 6D Gaia samples
presented in Katz et al. and Antoja et al. We find that the complex
pattern in the velocity field is well described by a model with tightly
wound tidally excited spirals from Sgr's impacts. This is the first
N-body model able to explain so many of the features in the data on
different scales in a consistent fashion. The failures of the models,
such as the excess amplitudes of the signal compared to the data, call
for the need of more detailed modeling through adapted numerical methods
tailored to the Milky Way (using test particle and full N-body
simulations) and its interaction with its principal perturber in the
last Gyr. These should help us gain insight into the excitation of
spiral arms, the bar and the mass-loss history of the Sgr dwarf. The
successes presented here suggest that this goal is within reach.

	Abstract = {{We use data from the second data releases of the ESA Gaia astrometric
survey and the high-resolution GALAH spectroscopic survey to analyse the
structure of our Galaxy's discs. With GALAH, we can separate the
alpha-rich and alpha-poor discs (with respect to Fe), which are
superposed in both position and velocity space, and examine their
distributions in action space. We find clear evidence that young ($\lt$ 3
Gyr), metal-rich ([Fe/H] $\gt$ 0.1) dwarfs have migrated from the inner
alpha-poor disc to the solar neighbourhood. We examine the distribution
of stars in the z-V\_z phase plane in which a remarkable `phase spiral'
was recently discovered. We show that the spiral extends well beyond the
narrow cylinder in which it was found and is present in both discs but
appears most clearly in stars on less eccentric orbits. We display the
phase spiral in V\_phi in addition to V\_R and identify the quadrupole
signature in the z-V\_z plane of a tilting velocity ellipsoid. The spiral
is a signature of corrugated waves that propagate through the disc, and
the associated non-equilibrium phase mixing; our results rule out the
idea that it is associated with disrupting star clusters. The radially
asymmetric distribution of stars involved in the phase spiral shows that
the corrugation, which is mostly confined to the alpha-poor disc, grows
in z-amplitude as a function of increasing radius. We present new
simulations of tidal disturbance of the Galactic disc by a halo
substructure similar to the Sagittarius (Sgr) dwarf. The effects on the
z-V\_z plane of the substructure passing through the disc last at least 2
Gyr, but a subsequent disc crossing wipes out the coherent structure.
These simulations suggest that the phase spiral was created 500 Myr ago
as an object like Sgr with total mass 3x10\^{}$\{$10$\}$ Msun (stripped down from
5x10\^{}$\{$10$\}$ Msun when it first entered the halo) passed through the plane.

Way are under way or are being planned. In this context it is important
to discuss the extent to which elemental abundances can be used as
discriminators between different (known and unknown) stellar populations

terms of precision in elemental abundances, as derived from
spectroscopic surveys of the Milky Way's stellar populations, in order
to detect interesting substructures in elemental abundance space. <BR />
Methods: We used Monte Carlo simulations to examine under which
conditions substructures in elemental abundance space can realistically
be detected. <BR /> Results: We present a simple relation between the
minimum number of stars needed to detect a given substructure and the
precision of the measurements. The results are in agreement with recent
small- and large-scale studies, with high and low precision,
respectively. <BR /> Conclusions: Large-number statistics cannot fully
compensate for low precision in the abundance measurements. Each survey
should carefully evaluate what the main science drivers are for the
survey and ensure that the chosen observational strategy will result in
the precision necessary to answer the questions posed.

	Abstract = {{Precise stellar ages from asteroseismology have become available and can
help setting stronger constraints on the evolution of the Galactic disc
components. Recently, asteroseismology has confirmed a clear age
difference in the solar annulus between two distinct sequences in the
[$\alpha$/Fe] versus [Fe/H] abundance ratios relation: the high-$\alpha$
and low-$\alpha$ stellar populations. We aim at reproducing these new
data with chemical evolution models including different assumptions for
the history and number of accretion events. We tested two different
approaches: a revised version of the `two-infall' model where the
high-$\alpha$ phase forms by a fast gas accretion episode and the
low-$\alpha$ sequence follows later from a slower gas infall rate, and
the parallel formation scenario where the two disc sequences form
coevally and independently. The revised `two-infall' model including
uncertainties in age and metallicity is capable of reproducing: i) the
[$\alpha$/Fe] vs. [Fe/H] abundance relation at different Galactic
epochs, ii) the age$-$metallicity relation and the time evolution
[$\alpha$/Fe]; iii) the age distribution of the high-$\alpha$ and
low-$\alpha$ stellar populations, iv) the metallicity distribution
function. The parallel approach is not capable of properly reproduce the
stellar age distribution, in particular at old ages. In conclusion, the
best chemical evolution model is the revised `two-infall' one, where a
consistent delay of $\sim$4.3 Gyr in the beginning of the second gas
accretion episode is a crucial assumption to reproduce stellar
abundances and ages.

peaks with the thick disk, inner-halo and outer-halo components of the
Galaxy. The metallicity distribution of these giant stars, which is fit
with Gaussians corresponding to the three components, show a growing
fraction of inner-halo component and declining fraction of the
thick-disk component with increasing distance from the Galactic plane.
Adopting a galaxy potential model, we also derive the orbital parameters
of the sample stars, such as orbit eccentricity and rotation velocity.
The peak values of derived orbital eccentricity for stars covering
different metallicity regions maintain $e\sim$ 0.75, independent of
height above the plane, within the range 5$\lt|z|\lt$ 15 kpc. By
comparing the MDFs of stars in different rotation velocity intervals, we
find that the majority of the retrograde stars are more metal-poor than
the prograde stars.

	Abstract = {{We report an analysis of the metal-rich tail ([Fe/H] $\gt -0.75$) of
halo stars located at distances from the Galactic plane $z$ up to $|z|
\sim 10$ kpc, observed by the Apache Point Observatory Galactic
Evolution Experiment (APOGEE). We examine the chemistry, kinematics, and
dynamics of this metal-rich halo sample using chemical abundances and
radial velocities provided by the fourteenth APOGEE data release (DR14)
and proper motions from the second Gaia data release (DR2). The analysis
reveals three chemically different stellar populations in the [Mg/Fe]
vs. [Fe/H] space -- the two distinct halo populations already reported
in the literature, and a third group with intermediate [Mg/Fe]
$\sim$+0.1. We derive the $U$, $V$ and $W$ velocity components with
respect to the Local Standard of Rest, as well as orbits for the three
stellar groups, and find that they differ also in their kinematical and
dynamical properties. The high-[Mg/Fe] population exhibits a mean
prograde rotation, as well as orbits that are more bound and closer to
the plane, whereas the low-[Mg/Fe] population has $\ltV\gt$ closer to
0, and stars that move in less-bound orbits reaching larger distances
from the centre and the Galactic plane. The intermediate-Mg stars
exhibit different orbital characteristics, moving with a strong prograde
rotation and low excentricity, but in less-bound orbits. This stellar
population resembles the two stellar overdensities lying about $|z| \sim
5$ kpc recently reported in the literature, for which a disc origin has
been claimed.

	Abstract = {{Context. The most primitive metal-poor stars are important for studying
the conditions of the early galaxy and are also relevant to big bang
nucleosynthesis. <BR /> Aims: Our objective is to find the brightest
(V$\lt$ 14) most metal-poor stars. <BR /> Methods: Candidates were
selected using a new method, which is based on the mismatch between
spectral types derived from colors and observed spectral types. They
were observed first at low resolution with EFOSC2 at the NTT to obtain
an initial set of stellar parameters. The most promising candidate,
<ASTROBJ>2MASS J18082002-5104378</ASTROBJ> (V = 11.9), was observed at
high resolution (R = 50 000) with UVES at the VLT, and a standard
abundance analysis was performed. <BR /> Results: We found that
<ASTROBJ>2MASS J18082002-5104378</ASTROBJ> is an ultra metal-poor star
with stellar parameters T$_{eff}$ = 5440 K, log g = 3.0 dex,
v$_{t}$ = 1.5 km s$^{-1}$, [Fe/H] = -4.1 dex. The star has
[C/Fe] $\lt$ +0.9 in a 1D analysis, or [C/Fe] {\lsim} +0.5 if 3D effects
are considered; its abundance pattern is typical of normal (non-CEMP)
ultra metal-poor stars. Interestingly, the star has a binary companion.
<BR /> Conclusions: <ASTROBJ>2MASS J1808-5104</ASTROBJ> is the brightest
(V = 11.9) metal-poor star of its category, and it could be studied
further with even higher S/N spectroscopy to determine additional
chemical abundances, thus providing important constraints to the early
chemical evolution of our Galaxy.

Based on observations obtained at the European Southern Observatory
(ESO) Very Large Telescope (VLT, observing program 293.D-5036) and New
Technology Telescope (NTT, observing programs 091.D-0292 and
092.D-0308).

	Abstract = {{Sparse open clusters can be found at high galactic latitudes where
loosely populated clusters are more easily detected against the lower
stellar background. Because most star formation takes place in the thin
disk, the observed population of clusters far from the Galactic plane is
hard to explain. We combined spectral parameters from the GALAH survey
with the Gaia DR2 catalogue to study the dynamics and chemistry of five
old sparse high-latitude clusters in more detail. We find that four of
them (NGC 1252, NGC 6994, NGC 7772, NGC 7826) - originally classified in
1888 - are not clusters but are instead chance projections on the sky.
Member stars quoted in the literature for these four clusters are
unrelated in our multi-dimensional physical parameter space; the
published cluster properties are therefore irrelevant. We confirm the
existence of morphologically similar NGC 1901 for which we provide a
probabilistic membership analysis. An overdensity in three spatial
dimensions proves to be enough to reliably detect sparse clusters, but
the whole 6-dimensional space must be used to identify members with high
confidence, as demonstrated in the case of NGC 1901.

galaxies form and evolve from the Big Bang until the present-time. The
Gaia mission was conceived to unravel the assembly history of our own
Galaxy, the Milky Way. Gaia's recently delivered second data release
allows tackling this objective like never before. Here we analyse the
kinematics, chemistry, age and spatial distribution of stars in a
relatively large volume around the Sun that are mainly linked to two
major Galactic components, the thick disk and the stellar halo. We
demonstrate that the inner halo is dominated by debris from an object
slightly more massive than the Small Magellanic Cloud, and which we
refer to as Gaia-Enceladus. The accretion of Gaia-Enceladus must have
led to the dynamical heating of the precursor of the thick disk and
hence contributed to the formation of this component approximately 10
Gyr ago.

@article{Ness2013,
	Abstract = {{We present the metallicity results from the ARGOS spectroscopic survey
of the Galactic bulge. Our aim is to understand the formation of the
Galactic bulge: did it form via mergers, as expected from {$\Lambda$} cold
dark matter theory, or from disc instabilities, as suggested by its
boxy/peanut shape, or both? Our stars are mostly red clump giants, which
have a well-defined absolute magnitude from which distances can be
determined. We have obtained spectra for 28 000 stars at a spectral
resolution of R = 11 000. From these spectra, we have determined stellar
parameters and distances to an accuracy of $\lt$1.5 kpc. The stars in the
inner Galaxy span a large range in [Fe/H], -2.8 {\le} [Fe/H] {\le} +0.6.
From the spatial distribution of the red clump stars as a function of
[Fe/H], we propose that the stars with [Fe/H] $\gt$ -0.5 are part of the
boxy/peanut bar/bulge. We associate the lower metallicity stars ([Fe/H]
$\lt$ -0.5) with the thick disc, which may be puffed up in the inner
region, and with the inner regions of the metal-weak thick disc and
inner halo. For the bulge stars with [Fe/H] $\gt$ -0.5, we find two
discrete populations: (i) stars with [Fe/H] {\ap} -0.25 which provide a
roughly constant fraction of the stars in the latitude interval b =
-5{\deg} to -10{\deg}, and (ii) a kinematically colder, more metal-rich
population with mean [Fe/H] {\ap} +0.15 which is more prominent closer to
the plane. The changing ratio of these components with latitude appears
as a vertical abundance gradient of the bulge. We attribute both of
these bulge components to instability-driven bar/bulge formation from
the thin disc. We associate the thicker component with the stars of the
early less metal-rich thin disc, and associate the more metal-rich
population concentrated to the plane with the colder more metal-rich
stars of the early thin disc, similar to the colder and younger more
metal-rich stars seen in the thin disc in the solar neighbourhood today.
We do not exclude a weak underlying classical merger-generated bulge
component, but see no obvious kinematic association of any of our bulge
stars with such a classical bulge component. The clear spatial and
kinematic separation of the two bulge populations (i) and (ii) makes it
unlikely that any significant merger event could have affected the inner
regions of the Galaxy since the time when the bulge-forming
instabilities occurred.

	Abstract = {{Most of the stars in our Galaxy including our Sun, move in a disk-like
component and give the Milky Way its characteristic appearance on the
night sky. As in all fields in science, motions can be used to reveal
the underlying forces, and in the case of disk stars they provide
important diagnostics on the structure and history of the Galaxy. But
because of the challenges involved in measuring stellar motions, samples
have so far remained limited in their number of stars, precision and
spatial extent. This has changed dramatically with the second Data
Release of the Gaia mission which has just become available. Here we
report that the phase space distribution of stars in the disk of the
Milky Way is full of substructure with a variety of morphologies, most
of which have never been observed before. This includes shapes such as
arches and shells in velocity space, and snail shells and ridges when
spatial and velocity coordinates are combined. The nature of these
substructures implies that the disk is phase mixing from an out of
equilibrium state, and that the Galactic bar and/or spiral structure are
strongly affecting the orbits of disk stars. Our analysis of the
features leads us to infer that the disk was perturbed between 300 and
900 Myr ago, which matches current estimations of the previous
pericentric passage of the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy. The Gaia data
challenge the most basic premise of stellar dynamics of dynamical
equilibrium, and show that modelling the Galactic disk as a
time-independent axisymmetric component is definitively incorrect. These
findings mark the start of a new era when, by modelling the richness of
phase space substructures, we can determine the gravitational potential
of the Galaxy, its time evolution and the characteristics of the
perturbers that have most influenced our home in the Universe.

We construct analytic models of the winding spiral structure, and
compare the resulting distribution of orbits with the observed
two-dimensional velocity distribution in the extended solar
neighbourhood and with the distribution of rotational velocities over 8
kpc along the Sun-Galactic-centre-Galactic anti-centre line. We show
that the ridges in these observations are well reproduced by the winding

Pan-STARRS grz and WISE W1 and W2 photometry. We utilize a subsample of
bright stars with precise parallaxes from Gaia DR2 to verify that the
color-based selection reliably separates dwarfs from giants. The
selection is conservative in the sense that contamination is small but
not all giants are included (the selection primarily identifies K
giants). The color-based selection can be applied to stars brighter than
$W1\approx16$, more than two magnitudes fainter than techniques relying
on shallower 2MASS photometry. Many streams and clouds are visible in
the resulting sky maps, especially when binned by Gaia DR2 proper
motions, including the Sagittarius stream, the Hercules-Aquila Cloud,
the Eastern Banded Structure, Monoceros, and the Virgo Overdensity. In
addition to the characterization of new and known stellar streams, we
expect that this method for selecting red giants will enable detailed
analysis of the diffuse stellar halo to distances exceeding 100 kpc.

	Abstract = {{We present a catalogue of distances, masses and ages for $\sim3$ million
stars observed by Gaia with spectroscopic parameters available from the
large spectroscopic surveys: APOGEE, Gaia-ESO, GALAH, LAMOST, RAVE and
SEGUE. We use a Bayesian framework to characterise the probability
density functions of distance, mass and age using photometric,
spectroscopic and astrometric information, supplemented with
spectroscopic masses where available for giant stars. Furthermore, we
provide posterior extinction estimates ($A\_V$) to every star using
published extinction maps as a prior input. We provide an appendix with
extinction coefficients for Gaia photometry derived from stellar models,
which account for variation with intrinsic colour and total extinction.
Our pipeline provides output estimates of the spectroscopic parameters,
which can be used to inform improved spectroscopic analysis. We
complement our catalogues with Galactocentric coordinates and actions
with associated uncertainties. As a demonstration of the power of our
catalogue, we produce velocity dispersion profiles of the disc separated
by age and Galactocentric radius. This suggests that the velocity
dispersion profiles flatten with radius in the outer Galaxy and that at
all radii the velocity dispersion follows the smooth power law with age
observed in the solar neighbourhood.

	Abstract = {{We use the first Gaia data release, combined with the RAVE and APOGEE
spectroscopic surveys, to investigate the origin of halo stars within
{\lsim} 3 kpc from the Sun. We identify halo stars kinematically as
moving at a relative speed of at least 220 km s$^{-1}$ with
respect to the local standard of rest. These stars are generally less
metal-rich than the disk, but surprisingly, half of our halo sample is
comprised of stars with [$\{$Fe$\}$/$\{$$\{$H$\}$$\}$]$\gt$ -1. The orbital directions of
these metal-rich halo stars are preferentially aligned with the disk
rotation, in sharp contrast with the intrinsically isotropic orbital
distribution of the metal-poor halo stars. We find similar properties in
the Latte cosmological zoom-in simulation of a Milky Way-like galaxy
from the FIRE project. In Latte, metal-rich halo stars formed primarily
inside of the solar circle, whereas lower-metallicity halo stars
preferentially formed at larger distances (extending beyond the virial
radius). This suggests that metal-rich halo stars in the solar
neighborhood actually formed in situ within the Galactic disk, rather
than having been accreted from satellite systems. These stars, currently
on halo-like orbits, therefore have likely undergone substantial radial
migration/heating.

in the magnitude range 3 to 21 based on observations collected by the
European Space Agency Gaia satellite during the first 22 months of its
operational phase. We describe the input data, models, and processing
used for the astrometric content of Gaia DR2, and the validation of
these results performed within the astrometry task. Some 320 billion
centroid positions from the pre-processed astrometric CCD observations
were used to estimate the five astrometric parameters (positions,
parallaxes, and proper motions) for 1332 million sources, and
approximate positions at the reference epoch J2015.5 for an additional
361 million mostly faint sources. Special validation solutions were used
to characterise the random and systematic errors in parallax and proper
motion. For the sources with five-parameter astrometric solutions, the
median uncertainty in parallax and position at the reference epoch
J2015.5 is about 0.04 mas for bright (G$\lt$14 mag) sources, 0.1 mas at
G=17 mag, and 0.7 mas at G=20 mag. In the proper motion components the
corresponding uncertainties are 0.05, 0.2, and 1.2 mas/yr, respectively.
The optical reference frame defined by Gaia DR2 is aligned with ICRS and
is non-rotating with respect to the quasars to within 0.15 mas/yr. From
the quasars and validation solutions we estimate that systematics in the
parallaxes depending on position, magnitude, and colour are generally
below 0.1 mas, but the parallaxes are on the whole too small by about
0.03 mas. Significant spatial correlations of up to 0.04 mas in parallax
and 0.07 mas/yr in proper motion are seen on small ($\lt$1 deg) and
intermediate (20 deg) angular scales. Important statistics and
information for the users of the Gaia DR2 astrometry are given in the
appendices.

	Abstract = {{Recent analysis of the SDSS-III/Apache Point Observatory Galactic
Evolution Experiment (APOGEE) Data Release 12 stellar catalog has
revealed that the Milky Way{\rsquo}s (MW) metallicity distribution
function (MDF) changes shape as a function of radius, transitioning from
being negatively skewed at small Galactocentric radii to positively
skewed at large Galactocentric radii. Using a high-resolution,
N-body+SPH simulation, we show that the changing skewness arises from
radial migration{\mdash}metal-rich stars form in the inner disk and
subsequently migrate to the metal-poorer outer disk. These migrated
stars represent a large fraction ($\backslash$gt 50\%) of the stars in the outer
disk; they populate the high-metallicity tail of the MDFs and are, in
general, more metal-rich than the surrounding outer disk gas. The
simulation also reproduces another surprising APOGEE result: the
spatially invariant high-[{$\alpha$}/Fe] MDFs. This arises in the
simulation from the migration of a population formed within a narrow
range of radii (3.2 {\plusmn}1.2 kpc) and time (8.8 {\plusmn} 0.6 Gyr
ago), rather than from spatially extended star formation in a
homogeneous medium at early times. These results point toward the
crucial role radial migration has played in shaping our MW.

	Abstract = {{The compositions of stars are a critical diagnostic tool for many topics
in astronomy such as the evolution of our Galaxy, the formation of
planets, and the uniqueness of the Sun. Previous spectroscopic
measurements indicate a large intrinsic variation in the elemental
abundance patterns of stars with similar overall metal content. However,
systematic errors arising from inaccuracies in stellar models are known
to be a limiting factor in such studies, and thus it is uncertain to
what extent the observed diversity of stellar abundance patterns is
real. Here we report the abundances of 30 elements with precisions of 2\%
for 79 Sun-like stars within 100 parsecs. Systematic errors are
minimized in this study by focusing on solar twin stars and performing a
line-by-line differential analysis using high-resolution,
high-signal-to-noise spectra. We resolve [X/Fe] abundance trends in
galactic chemical evolution at precisions of 10\^{}-3 dex Gyr\^{}-1 and reveal
that stars with similar ages and metallicities have nearly identical
abundance patterns. Contrary to previous results, we find that the
ratios of carbon-to-oxygen and magnesium-to-silicon are homogeneous to
within 10\% throughout the solar neighborhood, implying that exoplanets
may exhibit much less compositional diversity than previously thought.
Finally, we demonstrate that the Sun has a subtle deficiency in
refractory material relative to \~{}95\% of solar twins, suggesting a
possible signpost for planetary systems like our own.

the second Gaia data release (DR2) allows to study small-scale structure
in the orbit distribution of the Galactic disc beyond the immediate
Solar neighborhood. We investigate the distribution of orbital actions
$(J\_R,J\_\phi=L\_z,J\_z)$ of $\sim 3.5$ million stars within
$1.5~\text{kpc}$ of the Sun, for which precise actions can be calculated
from Gaia DR2 alone. This distribution $n(J\_R,L\_z)$ reveals a remarkable
amount of sub-structure. The known moving groups in the $(U,V)$-plane of
the Solar neighborhood correspond to overdensities in $(J\_R,L\_z)$, as
expected. But $n(J\_R,L\_z)$ also exhibits a wealth of density clumps and
ridges that extend towards higher $J\_R$. These $n(J\_R,L\_z)$ features are
most prominent among orbits that stay close to the Galactic plane and
remain consistently visible out to $\sim1.5~\text{kpc}$, as opposed to
the sub-structure in velocity space. Some of these $n(J\_R,L\_z)$ ridges
resemble features expected from rapid orbit diffusion along particular
($J\_R,L\_z$)-directions in the presence of various resonances. Several of
these $n(J\_R,L\_z)$ structures show a dramatic imbalance of stars moving
in or out, suggesting that stars are not phase-mixed along orbits or on
resonant orbits. Orbital action and angle space of stars in Gaia DR2 is
therefore highly structured over kpc-scales, and appears to be very
informative for modeling studies of non-axisymmetric structure and
resonances in the Galactic disc.

astrometry, photometry, radial velocities, and information on
astrophysical parameters and variability, for sources brighter than

the contents of Gaia DR2 is presented, accompanied by a discussion on
the differences with respect to Gaia DR1 and an overview of the main
limitations which are still present in the survey. Recommendations are
made on the responsible use of Gaia DR2 results. Gaia DR2 contains
celestial positions and the apparent brightness in G for approximately
1.7 billion sources. For 1.3 billion of those sources, parallaxes and
proper motions are in addition available. The sample of sources for
which variability information is provided is expanded to 0.5 million
stars. This data release contains four new elements: broad-band colour
information in the form of the apparent brightness in the
$G\_\mathrm{BP}$ (330--680 nm) and $G\_\mathrm{RP}$ (630--1050 nm) bands
is available for 1.4 billion sources; median radial velocities for some
7 million sources are presented; for between 77 and 161 million sources
estimates are provided of the stellar effective temperature, extinction,
reddening, and radius and luminosity; and for a pre-selected list of
14000 minor planets in the solar system epoch astrometry and photometry
are presented. Finally, Gaia DR2 also represents a new materialisation
of the celestial reference frame in the optical, the Gaia-CRF2, which is
the first optical reference frame based solely on extragalactic sources.
There are notable changes in the photometric system and the catalogue
source list with respect to Gaia DR1, and we stress the need to consider
the two data releases as independent.

	Abstract = {{Aims. We describe the photometric content of the second data release of
the Gaia project (Gaia DR2) and its validation along with the quality of
the data. Methods. The validation was mainly carried out using an
internal analysis of the photometry. External comparisons were also
made, but were limited by the precision and systematics that may be
present in the external catalogues used. Results. In addition to the
photometric quality assessment, we present the best estimates of the
three photometric passbands. Various colour-colour transformations are
also derived to enable the users to convert between the Gaia and
commonly used passbands. Conclusions. The internal analysis of the data
shows that the photometric calibrations can reach a precision as low as
2 mmag on individual CCD measurements. Other tests show that systematic
effects are present in the data at the 10 mmag level.

@article{Andrae2018,
	Abstract = {{The second Gaia data release (Gaia-DR2) contains, beyond the astrometry,
three-band photometry for 1.38 billion sources. We have used these three
broad bands to infer stellar effective temperatures, Teff, for all
sources brighter than G=17 mag with Teff in the range 3000-10 000 K (161
million sources). Using in addition the parallaxes, we infer the
line-of-sight extinction, A\_G, and the reddening, E[BP-RP], for 88
million sources. Together with a bolometric correction we derive
luminosity and radius for 77 million sources. These quantities as well
as their estimated uncertainties are part of Gaia-DR2. Here we describe
the procedures by which these quantities were obtained, including the
underlying assumptions, comparison with literature estimates, and the
limitations of our results. Typical accuracies are of order 324 K
(Teff), 0.46 mag (A\_G), 0.23 mag (E[BP-RP]), 15\% (luminosity), and 10\%
(radius). Being based on only a small number of observable quantities
and limited training data, our results are necessarily subject to some
extreme assumptions that can lead to strong systematics in some cases
(not included in the aforementioned accuracy estimates). One aspect is
the non-negativity contraint of our estimates, in particular extinction.
Yet in several regions of parameter space our results show very good
performance, for example for red clump stars and solar analogues. Large
uncertainties render the extinctions less useful at the individual star
level, but they show good performance for ensemble estimates. We
identify regimes in which our parameters should and should not be used
and we define a ``clean'' sample. Despite the limitations, this is the
largest catalogue of uniformly-inferred stellar parameters to date. More
precise and detailed astrophysical parameters based on the full BP/RP
spectrophotometry are planned as part of the third Gaia data release.

@article{Babusiaux2018,
	Abstract = {{We highlight the power of the Gaia DR2 in studying many fine structures
of the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram (HRD). Gaia allows us to present many
different HRDs, depending in particular on stellar population
selections. We do not aim here for completeness in terms of types of
stars or stellar evolutionary aspects. Instead, we have chosen several
illustrative examples. We describe some of the selections that can be
made in Gaia DR2 to highlight the main structures of the Gaia HRDs. We
select both field and cluster (open and globular) stars, compare the
observations with previous classifications and with stellar evolutionary
tracks, and we present variations of the Gaia HRD with age, metallicity,
and kinematics. Late stages of stellar evolution such as hot subdwarfs,
post-AGB stars, planetary nebulae, and white dwarfs are also analysed,
as well as low-mass brown dwarf objects. The Gaia HRDs are unprecedented
in both precision and coverage of the various Milky Way stellar
populations and stellar evolutionary phases. Many fine structures of the
HRDs are presented. The clear split of the white dwarf sequence into
hydrogen and helium white dwarfs is presented for the first time in an
HRD. The relation between kinematics and the HRD is nicely illustrated.
Two different populations in a classical kinematic selection of the halo
are unambiguously identified in the HRD. Membership and mean parameters
for a selected list of open clusters are provided. They allow drawing
very detailed cluster sequences, highlighting fine structures, and
providing extremely precise empirical isochrones that will lead to more
insight in stellar physics. Gaia DR2 demonstrates the potential of
combining precise astrometry and photometry for large samples for
studies in stellar evolution and stellar population and opens an entire
new area for HRD-based studies.

@article{SDSSDR14,
	Abstract = {{The fourth generation of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS-IV) has been
in operation since 2014 July. This paper describes the second data
release from this phase, and the 14th from SDSS overall (making this
Data Release Fourteen or DR14). This release makes the data taken by
SDSS-IV in its first two years of operation (2014{\ndash}2016 July)
public. Like all previous SDSS releases, DR14 is cumulative, including
the most recent reductions and calibrations of all data taken by SDSS
since the first phase began operations in 2000. New in DR14 is the first
public release of data from the extended Baryon Oscillation
Spectroscopic Survey; the first data from the second phase of the Apache
Point Observatory (APO) Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE-2),
including stellar parameter estimates from an innovative data-driven
machine-learning algorithm known as {\ldquo}The Cannon{\rdquo} and almost
twice as many data cubes from the Mapping Nearby Galaxies at APO (MaNGA)
survey as were in the previous release (N = 2812 in total). This paper
describes the location and format of the publicly available data from
the SDSS-IV surveys. We provide references to the important technical
papers describing how these data have been taken (both targeting and
observation details) and processed for scientific use. The SDSS web site
(<A href=``http://www.sdss.org''>www.sdss.org</A>) has been updated for
this release and provides links to data downloads, as well as tutorials
and examples of data use. SDSS-IV is planning to continue to collect
astronomical data until 2020 and will be followed by SDSS-V.

	Abstract = {{[ABRIDGED] We determine Li abundances for a well-studied sample of 714 F
and G dwarf, turn-off, and subgiant stars in the solar neighbourhood.
The analysis is based on line synthesis of the Li line at 6707 $\{$$\backslash$AA$\}$ in
high-resolution and high signal-to-noise ratio echelle spectra, obtained
with the MIKE, FEROS, SOFIN, UVES, and FIES spectrographs. The presented
Li abundances are corrected for non-LTE effects. Out of the sample of
714 stars we are able to determine Li abundances for 420 stars and upper
limits on the Li abundance for another 121 stars. 18 of the stars with
well-determined Li abundances are listed as exoplanet host stars. Our
main finding is that there are no signatures of Li production in the
thick disk, but the Li abundance for stars of the same effective
temperature is independent of metallicity for stars that can be
associated with the Galactic thick disk. Significant Li production is
however seen in the thin disk, with a steady increase towards
super-solar metallicities. At the highest metallicities, however, around
[Fe/H]\~{} +0.3, we tentatively confirm the recent discovery that the Li
abundances level out. We hence contradict the recent finding in other
studies that found that Li is also produced in the thick disk. This is
likely due to the chemically defined selection criteria those studies
used to define their thick disk samples. Age criteria that we use here,
produce a thick disk stellar sample that is much less contaminated by
thin disk stars, and hence more reliable abundance trends. [ABRIDGED] A
conclusion that can be drawn is that no significant Li production,
relative to the primordial abundance, took place during the first few
billion years of the Milky Way, an era coinciding with the formation and
evolution of the thick disk. [ABRIDGED]

	Abstract = {{For the vast majority of stars in the second Gaia data release, reliable
distances cannot be obtained by inverting the parallax. A correct
inference procedure must instead be used to account for the nonlinearity
of the transformation and the asymmetry of the resulting probability
distribution. Here we infer distances to essentially all 1.33 billion
stars with parallaxes published in the second Gaia data release. This is
done using a weak distance prior that varies smoothly as a function of
Galactic longitude and latitude according to a Galaxy model. The
irreducible uncertainty in the distance estimate is characterized by the
lower and upper bounds of an asymmetric confidence interval. Although
more precise distances can be estimated for a subset of the stars using
additional data (such as photometry), our goal is to provide purely
geometric distance estimates, independent of assumptions about the
physical properties of, or interstellar extinction towards, individual
stars. We analyse the characteristics of the catalogue and validate it
using clusters. The catalogue can be queried using ADQL at
http://gaia.ari.uni-heidelberg.de/tap.html (which also hosts the Gaia
catalogue) as the table geometric\_distance in the schema
gaiadr2\_complements. The catalogue will go live on or before 30 April.

	Abstract = {{The primary goal of Galactic archaeology is to learn about the origin of
the Milky Way from the detailed chemistry and kinematics of millions of
stars. Wide-field multi-fibre spectrographs are increasingly used to
obtain spectral information for huge samples of stars. Some surveys
(e.g. GALAH) are attempting to measure up to 30 separate elements per
star. Stellar abundance spectroscopy is a subtle art that requires a
very high degree of spectral uniformity across each of the fibres.
However wide-field spectrographs are notoriously non-uniform due to the
fast output optics necessary to image many fibre outputs onto the
detector. We show that precise spectroscopy is possible with such
instruments across all fibres by employing a photonic comb -- a device
that produces uniformly spaced spots of light on the CCD to precisely
map complex aberrations. Aberrations are parametrized by a set of
orthogonal moments with $\sim100$ independent parameters. We then
reproduce the observed image by convolving high resolution spectral
templates with measured aberrations as opposed to extracting the spectra
from the observed image. Such a forward modeling approach also
trivializes some spectroscopic reduction problems like fibre cross-talk,
and reliably extracts spectra with a resolution $\sim2.3$ times above
the nominal resolution of the instrument. Our rigorous treatment of
optical aberrations also encourages a less conservative spectrograph
design in the future.

	Abstract = {{We present a study using the second data release of the GALAH survey of
stellar parameters and elemental abundances of 15 pairs of stars
identified by Oh et al 2017. They identified these pairs as potentially
co-moving pairs using proper motions and parallaxes from Gaia DR1. We
find that 11 very wide ($\gt$1.7 pc) pairs of stars do in fact have
similar Galactic orbits, while a further four claimed co-moving pairs
are not truly co-orbiting. Eight of the 11 co-orbiting pairs have
reliable stellar parameters and abundances, and we find that three of
those are quite similar in their abundance patterns, while five have
significant [Fe/H] differences. For the latter, this indicates that they
could be co-orbiting because of the general dynamical coldness of the
thin disc, or perhaps resonances induced by the Galaxy, rather than a
shared formation site. Stars such as these, wide binaries, debris of
past star formation episodes, and coincidental co-orbiters, are crucial
for exploring the limits of chemical tagging in the Milky Way.

	Abstract = {{We report the serendipitous observations of 571 luminous supergiants in
the Magellanic Clouds by the spectroscopic GALAH and TESS-HERMES
surveys: 434 stars in the Large Magellanic Cloud and 137 in the Small
Magellanic Cloud. We also find one star that appears associated with
structured star formation in the Magellanic Bridge. Both of these
surveys are aimed at the local volume of the Galaxy but have simple,
magnitude-limited selection functions that mean they include some
observations of luminous extra-Galactic stars. The surveys determine
stellar parameter and abundances using The Cannon, a data-driven
generative modelling approach. In this work, we explore the results from
The Cannon when it is fed the spectra of these intrinsically luminous
supergiants in the Magellanic Clouds, which are well outside the normal
bounds of The Cannon's training set. We find that, although the
parameters are astrophysically incorrect, the $v\sin i$ and the
abundances of lithium, barium, and magnesium are excellent discriminants
of these stars. It shows that in the future, with an expanded training
set, it should be possible to determine accurate values for these types
of stars.

	Abstract = {{GALAH is a large-scale magnitude-limited southern stellar spectroscopic
survey. Buder et al. provide values of stellar parameters and abundances
of 23 elements for 342,682 stars. Here we add a description of the
public release of radial velocities with a typical accuracy of 0.1 km/s
for 199,628 of these stars. This accuracy is achievable due to the large
wavelength coverage, high resolving power and good signal to noise ratio
of the observed spectra, but also because effects that are often
neglected, such as 3-dimensional convective motions in stellar
atmosphere, and gravitational redshift along the light-path from the
star to the observer are taken into account. We do not compare observed
and synthetic spectra directly, but we add an intermediate step in which
medians of observed spectra with virtually identical values of stellar
parameters are derived. These observed medians are nearly noiseless, as
they are obtained from between 103 and 2276 observed spectra belonging
to the same bin of stellar parameter values with a width of 50 K in
temperature, 0.2 dex in gravity, and 0.1 dex in metallicity. Hence we
are publicly releasing also a library of 1277 median spectra, which
trace the well-populated regions of the HR diagram for stars with
metallicity between -0.6 and +0.3. Our results are used to check the
radial velocities of six observed open clusters. The GALAH radial
velocities are complementary to Gaia DR2, in terms of magnitude
coverage, sample size and accuracy. They are an excellent match to the
accuracy of velocity components along the sky plane derived by Gaia for
the same stars. They can be used to study dynamics within stellar
clusters, associations and streams in the Galaxy. This may have
important applications for studies of the distribution of dark matter.
The library of medians of observed spectra will be useful as a reference
set in the visible range.

	Abstract = {{If the Galaxy is axisymmetric and in dynamical equilibrium, we expect
negligible fluctuations in the residual line-of-sight velocity field.
However, non-axisymmetric structures like a bar, spiral arms and merger
events can generate velocity fluctuations. Recent results using the
APOGEE survey find significant fluctuations in velocity for stars in the
midplane (|z|$\lt$ 0.25 kpc) and out to 5 kpc, which suggests that the
dynamical influence of the Milky Way's bar extends out to the Solar
neighborhood. Their measured power spectrum has a characteristic
amplitude of 11 km/s on a scale of \~{} 2.5 kpc. The existence of large
streaming motions on these scales has important implications for
determining the Sun's motion about the Galactic Centre. Using red clump
stars from the GALAH and APOGEE surveys, we map the line-of-sight
velocity field around the Sun out to distances of 5 kpc and up to 1.25
kpc from the Galactic Plane. By subtracting a smooth axisymmetric model
for the velocity field, we study the residual velocity fluctuations and
compare our findings with mock survey generated by Galaxia based on an
axisymmetric, steady state model. We find negligible large-scale
fluctuations away from the plane. In the mid-plane, we reproduce the
earlier APOGEE power spectrum results but with 20$\backslash$\% smaller amplitude
(9.5 km/s) after taking a few systematic effects into account (e.g.
volume completeness). The amplitude power is further reduced to 6.7 km/s
if a flexible axisymmetric model is used. Additionally, our mock
simulations show that, in the plane, the distances are underestimated
for high mass red clump stars and this can lead to spurious power with
amplitude of about 5.5 km/s. Taking this into account, we estimate the
amplitude of real fluctuations to be less than 4.2 km/s, about a factor
of three less than the previous result from APOGEE.

measurements of Li, C, O, Na, Mg, Al, Si, K, Ca, Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Co,

Fe), we employ non-LTE calculations. These elements represent several
nucleosynthesis channels including $\alpha$, iron-peak, and s-process.
We find strong correlations between stellar age and abundance, including
for $\alpha$-elements and the s-process elements Y and Ba. Furthermore,
in the high-$\alpha$ metal-rich regime, age can be used in combination
with chemistry to separate stars from the extended high-$\alpha$
sequence and the low-$\alpha$ one. We find that the low-$\alpha$
metal-poor stars in the solar neighbourhood have significantly higher
angular momentum $L\_z$ than the Sun, which implies that they are on
eccentric orbits and originate from the outer disk. Stars of the
high-$\alpha$-sequence on the other hand have lower $L\_z$ than the Sun,
implying they are visitors from the inner disk.

@article{DelgadoMena2017,
	Abstract = {{<BR /> Aims: To understand the formation and evolution of the different
stellar populations within our Galaxy it is essential to combine
detailed kinematical and chemical information for large samples of
stars. The aim of this work is to explore the chemical abundances of
neutron capture elements which are a product of different
nucleosynthesis processes taking place in diverse objects in the Galaxy,
such as massive stars, asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars and
supernovae (SNe) explosions. <BR /> Methods: We derive chemical
abundances of Cu, Zn, Sr, Y, Zr, Ba, Ce, Nd, and Eu for a large sample
of more than 1000 FGK dwarf stars with high-resolution (R   115 000) and
high-quality spectra from the HARPS-GTO program. The abundances are
derived by a standard local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) analysis
using measured equivalent widths (EWs) injected to the code MOOG and a
grid of Kurucz ATLAS9 atmospheres. <BR /> Results: We find that thick
disc stars are chemically disjunct for Zn and Eu and also show on
average higher Zr but lower Ba and Y than the thin disc stars. We also
discovered that the previously identified high-{$\alpha$} metal-rich
population is also enhanced in Cu, Zn, Nd, and Eu with respect to the
thin disc but presents lower Ba and Y abundances on average, following
the trend of thick disc stars towards higher metallities and further
supporting the different chemical composition of this population. By
making a qualitative comparison of O (pure {$\alpha$}), Mg, Eu (pure
r-process), and s-process elements we can distinguish between the
contribution of the more massive stars (SNe II for {$\alpha$} and r-process
elements) and the lower mass stars (AGBs) whose contribution to the
enrichment of the Galaxy is delayed, due to their longer lifetimes. The
ratio of heavy-s to light-s elements of thin disc stars presents the
expected behaviour (increasing towards lower metallicities) and can be
explained by a major contribution of low-mass AGB stars for s-process
production at disc metallicities. However, the opposite trend found for
thick disc stars suggests that intermediate-mass AGB stars play an
important role in the enrichment of the gas from where these stars
formed. Previous works in the literature also point to a possible
primary production of light-s elements at low metallicities to explain
this trend. Finally, we also find an enhancement of light-s elements in
the thin disc at super-solar metallicities which could be caused by the
contribution of metal-rich AGB stars. <BR /> Conclusions: This work
proves the utility of homogeneous and high-quality data of modest sample
sizes. We find some interesting trends that might help to differentiate
thin and thick disc population (such as [Zn/Fe] and [Eu/Fe] ratios) and
that can also provide useful constraints for Galactic chemical evolution
models of the different populations in the Galaxy.

	Abstract = {{Using data from the GALAH pilot survey, we determine properties of the
Galactic thin and thick discs near the solar neighbourhood. The data
cover a small range of Galactocentric radius (7.9 {\lsim} R\_GC {\lsim} 9.5
kpc), but extend up to 4 kpc in height from the Galactic plane, and
several kpc in the direction of Galactic anti-rotation (at longitude
260{\deg} {\le} {\ell} {\le} 280{\deg}). This allows us to reliably measure
the vertical density and abundance profiles of the chemically and
kinematically defined `thick' and `thin' discs of the Galaxy. The thin
disc (low-{$\alpha$} population) exhibits a steep negative vertical
metallicity gradient, at d[M/H]/dz = -0.18 {\plusmn} 0.01 dex
kpc$^{-1}$, which is broadly consistent with previous studies. In
contrast, its vertical {$\alpha$}-abundance profile is almost flat, with a
gradient of d[{$\alpha$}/M]/dz = 0.008 {\plusmn} 0.002 dex kpc$^{-1}$.
The steep vertical metallicity gradient of the low-{$\alpha$} population is
in agreement with models where radial migration has a major role in the
evolution of the thin disc. The thick disc (high-{$\alpha$} population) has
a weaker vertical metallicity gradient d[M/H]/dz = -0.058 {\plusmn} 0.003
dex kpc$^{-1}$. The {$\alpha$}-abundance of the thick disc is nearly
constant with height, d[{$\alpha$}/M]/dz = 0.007 {\plusmn} 0.002 dex
kpc$^{-1}$. The negative gradient in metallicity and the small
gradient in [{$\alpha$}/M] indicate that the high-{$\alpha$} population
experienced a settling phase, but also formed prior to the onset of
major Type Ia supernova enrichment. We explore the implications of the
distinct {$\alpha$}-enrichments and narrow [{$\alpha$}/M] range of the
sub-populations in the context of thick disc formation.

from the OGLE-III (third phase of the Optical Gravitational Lensing
Experiment) and VVV (VISTA Variables in the Via Lactea) surveys, with
supporting evidence from diffuse interstellar bands and F435W, F625W
photometry. We obtain independent measurements towards {\tilde}2000
sightlines of A$_{I}$, E(V - I), E(I - J) and E(J -

find that the variations in the extinction ratios A$_{I}$/E(V -
I), E(I - J)/E(V - I) and E(J - K$_{s}$)/E(V - I) are large
(exceeding 20 per cent), significant and positively correlated, as
expected. However, both the mean values and the trends in these
extinction ratios are drastically shifted from the predictions of
Cardelli and Fitzpatrick, regardless of how R$_{V}$ is varied.
Furthermore, we demonstrate that variations in the shape of the
extinction curve have at least two degrees of freedom, and not one (e.g.
R$_{V}$), which we confirm with a principal component analysis. We
derive a median value of $\lt$A$_{V}$/A$_{Ks}$$\gt$ = 13.44,
which is {\tilde}60 per cent higher than the `standard' value. We show
that the Wesenheit magnitude W$_{I}$ = I - 1.61(I - J) is
relatively impervious to extinction curve variations. Given that these
extinction curves are linchpins of observational cosmology, and that it
is generally assumed that R$_{V}$ variations correctly capture
variations in the extinction curve, we argue that systematic errors in
the distance ladder from studies of Type Ia supernovae and Cepheids may
have been underestimated. Moreover, the reddening maps from the Planck
experiment are shown to systematically overestimate dust extinction by
{\tilde}100 per cent and lack sensitivity to extinction curve variations.

	Abstract = {{Diffuse interstellar bands (DIBs) can trace different conditions of the
interstellar medium (ISM) along the sightline toward the observed stars.
A small survey was made in optical wavelengths, producing
high-resolution and high signal-to-noise spectra. We present
measurements of 19 DIBs' properties in 50 sightlines toward hot stars,
distributed at a variety of galactic coordinates and interstellar
reddening. Equivalent widths were obtained by fitting asymmetric
Gaussian and variable continua to DIBs. Conditions of the ISM were
calculated from eight atomic and molecular interstellar lines. Two
distinctly different types of DIBs were identified by carefully
comparing correlation coefficients between DIBs and reddening and by
different behavior in UV-shielded ({$\zeta$}) and nonshielded ({$\sigma$})
sightlines. A ratio of DIBs at 5780 {\AA} and 5797 {\AA} proved to
be reliable enough to distinguish between two different sightline types.
Based on the linear relations between DIB equivalent width and reddening
for {$\sigma$} and {$\zeta$} sightlines, we divide DIBs into type I (where
both linear relations are similar) and type II (where they are
significantly different). The linear relation for {$\zeta$} type sightlines
always shows a higher slope and larger x-intercept parameter than the
relation for {$\sigma$} sightlines. Scatter around the linear relation is
reduced after the separation, but it does not vanish completely. This
means that UV shielding is the dominant factor of the DIB equivalent
width versus reddening relation shape for {$\zeta$} sightlines, but in
{$\sigma$} sightlines other physical parameters play a major role. No
similar dependency on gas density, electron density, or turbulence was
observed. A catalog of all observed interstellar lines is made public.

	Abstract = {{The availability of a number of new interferometric measurements of Main
Sequence and subgiant stars makes it possible to calibrate the surface
brightness relations of these stars using exclusively direct angular
diameter measurements. These empirical laws make it possible to predict
the limb darkened angular diameters {\thetas}$_{LD}$ of dwarfs and
subgiants using their dereddened Johnson magnitudes, or their effective
temperature. The smallest intrinsic dispersions of {$\sigma$} {\le}1\% in
{\thetas}$_{LD}$ are obtained for the relations based on the K and
L magnitudes, for instance log {\thetas}$_{LD}$ = 0.0502 (B-L) +
0.5133 - 0.2 L or log {\thetas}$_{LD}$ = 0.0755 (V-K) + 0.5170 -
0.2 K. Our calibrations are valid between the spectral types A0 and M2
for dwarf stars (with a possible extension to later types when using the
effective temperature), and between A0 and K0 for subgiants. Such
relations are particularly useful for estimating the angular sizes of
calibrators for long-baseline interferometry from readily available

	Abstract = {{Using standard 1D-LTE model atmosphere analysis, we provide an in-depth
investigation of iron abundance as derived from neutral and singly
ionization iron lines (Fe I, II) in nearby star clusters. Specifically,
we replicate the discrepancy regarding {$\Delta$}[Fe/H], wherein the
difference of Fe II-Fe I increases for stars of the same cluster with
decreasing T $_{eff}$, reaching an astonishing 1.0 dex at T
$_{eff}$ {\tilde} 4000 K. Previous studies have investigated this
anomaly in the Pleiades and Hyades clusters with no concrete solution.
In this analysis, we probe two samples: 63 wide binary field stars where
the primary star is of Sun-like temperatures and the secondary is a
K-dwarf, ranging from 4231 K {\le} T $_{eff}$ {\le} 6453 K, and 33
Hyades stars of temperatures 4268 K {\le} T $_{eff}$ {\le} 6072 K.
Previous studies have found discrepancies on the order of 1.0 dex.
However, we find that these studies have neglected line-blending effects
of certain Fe II lines, namely {$\lambda$} = $\{$4508.29 {\AA}, 4993.34
{\AA}, 5197.58 {\AA}, 5325.55 {\AA}, 5425.26 {\AA}, 6456.38
{\AA}$\}$. When these lines are removed from the line-list, we find
{$\Delta$}[Fe/H] decreases to {\tilde}0.6 dex in the field binaries and
{\tilde}0.3 dex in the Hyades. The reason for this remaining trend is
investigated by probing NLTE effects, as well as age and activity
considerations using Ca II H+K emission and Li absorption, but these
results appear to be small to negligible.

	Abstract = {{SDSS-V will be an all-sky, multi-epoch spectroscopic survey of over six
million objects. It is designed to decode the history of the Milky Way,
trace the emergence of the chemical elements, reveal the inner workings
of stars, and investigate the origin of planets. It will also create an
integral-field spectroscopic map of the gas in the Galaxy and the Local
Group that is 1,000x larger than the current state of the art and at
high enough spatial resolution to reveal the self-regulation mechanisms
of galactic ecosystems. SDSS-V will pioneer systematic, spectroscopic
monitoring across the whole sky, revealing changes on timescales from 20
minutes to 20 years. The survey will thus track the flickers, flares,
and radical transformations of the most luminous persistent objects in
the universe: massive black holes growing at the centers of galaxies.
The scope and flexibility of SDSS-V will be unique among extant and
future spectroscopic surveys: it is all-sky, with matched survey
infrastructures in both hemispheres; it provides near-IR and optical
multi-object fiber spectroscopy that is rapidly reconfigurable to serve
high target densities, targets of opportunity, and time-domain
monitoring; and it provides optical, ultra-wide-field integral field
spectroscopy. SDSS-V, with its programs anticipated to start in 2020,
will be well-timed to multiply the scientific output from major space
missions (e.g., TESS, Gaia, eROSITA) and ground-based projects. SDSS-V
builds on the 25-year heritage of SDSS's advances in data analysis,
collaboration infrastructure, and product deliverables. The project is
now refining its science scope, optimizing the survey strategies, and
developing new hardware that builds on the SDSS-IV infrastructure. We
present here an overview of the current state of these developments as
we seek to build our worldwide consortium of institutional and
individual members.

	Abstract = {{Deciphering the assembly history of the Milky Way is a formidable task,
which becomes possible only if one can produce high-resolution
chrono-chemo-kinematical maps of the Galaxy. Data from large-scale
astrometric and spectroscopic surveys will soon provide us with a
well-defined view of the current chemo-kinematical structure of the
Milky Way, but will only enable a blurred view on the temporal sequence
that led to the present-day Galaxy. As demonstrated by the (ongoing)
exploitation of data from the pioneering photometric missions CoRoT,
Kepler, and K2, asteroseismology provides the way forward: solar-like
oscillating giants are excellent evolutionary clocks thanks to the
availability of seismic constraints on their mass and to the tight
age-initial-mass relation they adhere to. In this paper we identify five
key outstanding questions relating to the formation and evolution of the
Milky Way that will need precise and accurate ages for large samples of
stars to be addressed, and we identify the requirements in terms of
number of targets and the precision on the stellar properties that are
needed to tackle such questions. By quantifying the asteroseismic yields
expected from PLATO for red-giant stars, we demonstrate that these
requirements are within the capabilities of the current instrument
design, provided that observations are sufficiently long to identify the
evolutionary state and allow robust and precise determination of
acoustic-mode frequencies. This will allow us to harvest data of
sufficient quality to reach a 10\% precision in age. This is a
fundamental pre-requisite to then reach the more ambitious goal of a
similar level of accuracy, which will only be possible if we have to
hand a careful appraisal of systematic uncertainties on age deriving
from our limited understanding of stellar physics, a goal which
conveniently falls within the main aims of PLATO's core science.

	Abstract = {{The early stages of a galaxy's evolution leave an imprint on its
metallicity distribution. We discuss the origins and evolution of radial
metallicity gradients in discs of spiral galaxies using an analytical
chemical evolution model. We explain how radial metallicity gradients in
stellar populations are determined by three factors: the radial
metallicity profile of the star-forming interstellar medium (ISM),
radial changes in the star formation history (in particular, inside-out
formation) and radial mixing of stars. Under reasonable assumptions,
inside-out formation steepens the negative ISM metallicity gradient, but
contributes positively to the stellar metallicity gradient, up to
inverting the metallicity profile to a positive d[Fe/H]/dR. This
reconciles steep negative d[Fe/H]/dR in some high-redshift galaxies to
generally flatter gradients in local observations. We discuss the
evidence for inverse radial metallicity gradients (positive d[X/H]/dR)
at high redshifts and the inverse relationship between azimuthal
velocity and the metallicity (positive dV$_{varphi}$/d[Fe/H]) of
stars for the Milky Way's thick disc. The former can be achieved by high
central gas-loss rates and re-distribution processes, e.g. re-accretion
of enriched material in conjunction with the inside-out formation and
near-disc galactic fountaining. For the Milky Way-thick disc, we show
that the positive dV$_{varphi}$/d[Fe/H] correlation points to
comparable time-scales for inside-out formation, initial metal
enrichment and SNIa enrichment. We argue that the original ISM
metallicity gradient could be inferred with better data from the
high-metallicity tail of the alpha-enhanced population. Including
inside-out formation in our models changes the local vertical
metallicity gradient by about -0.2 dex kpc$^{-1}$, in line with
local measurements.

low-resolution (R \~{} 2000) spectra of 17,277 G-type dwarfs from the SEGUE
survey to separate them into likely thin- and thick-disk subsamples.
Both subsamples exhibit strong gradients of orbital rotational velocity
with metallicity, of opposite signs, -20 to -30 km s$^{-1}$
dex$^{-1}$ for the thin-disk and +40 to +50 km s$^{-1}$
dex$^{-1}$ for the thick-disk population. The rotational velocity
is uncorrelated with Galactocentric distance for the thin-disk subsample
and exhibits a small trend for the thick-disk subsample. The rotational
velocity decreases with distance from the plane for both disk
components, with similar slopes (-9.0 {\plusmn} 1.0 km s$^{-1}$
kpc$^{-1}$). Thick-disk stars exhibit a strong trend of orbital
eccentricity with metallicity (about -0.2 dex$^{-1}$), while the
eccentricity does not change with metallicity for the thin-disk
subsample. The eccentricity is almost independent of Galactocentric
radius for the thin-disk population, while a marginal gradient of the
eccentricity with radius exists for the thick-disk population. Both
subsamples possess similar positive gradients of eccentricity with
distance from the Galactic plane. The shapes of the eccentricity
distributions for the thin- and thick-disk populations are independent
of distance from the plane, and include no significant numbers of stars
with eccentricity above 0.6. Among several contemporary models of disk
evolution that we consider, radial migration appears to have played an
important role in the evolution of the thin-disk population, but
possibly less so for the thick disk, relative to the gas-rich merger or
disk heating scenarios. We emphasize that more physically realistic
models and simulations need to be constructed in order to carry out the
detailed quantitative comparisons that our new data enable.

measurements, together with empirical relations based on the APOKASC
sample, to infer stellar masses and implied ages for 230,000 of these
objects to 0.08 dex and 0.2 dex respectively. We use The Cannon, a
data-driven approach to spectral modeling, to construct a predictive
model for LAMOST spectra. Our reference set comprises 8125 stars
observed in common between the APOGEE and LAMOST surveys, taking seven
APOGEE DR12 labels (parameters) as ground truth: $\{$T$\}$$_{{eff}$$\}$,
$\{$log$\}$ g, [$\{$$\{$M$\}$$\}$/$\{$$\{$H$\}$$\}$], [{$\alpha$} /$\{$$\{$M$\}$$\}$], [$\{$$\{$C$\}$$\}$/$\{$$\{$M$\}$$\}$], [$\{$$\{$N$\}$$\}$/$\{$$\{$M$\}$$\}$],
and $\{$A$\}$$_{{{k}$$\}$$\}$. We add seven colors to the Cannon model, based
on the g, r, I, J, H, K, W1, W2 magnitudes from APASS, 2MASS, and WISE,
which improves our constraints on $\{$T$\}$$_{{eff}$$\}$ and $\{$log$\}$ g by up
to 20\% and on $\{$A$\}$$_{{{k}$$\}$$\}$ by up to 70\%. Cross-validation of the
model demonstrates that, for high-$\{$$\{$S$\}$$\}$/$\{$$\{$N$\}$$\}$ objects, our inferred
labels agree with the APOGEE values to within 50 K in temperature, 0.04
mag in $\{$A$\}$$_{{{k}$$\}$$\}$, and $\lt$ 0.1 dex in $\{$log$\}$ g, [$\{$$\{$M$\}$$\}$/$\{$$\{$H$\}$$\}$],
[$\{$$\{$C$\}$$\}$/$\{$$\{$M$\}$$\}$], [$\{$$\{$N$\}$$\}$/$\{$$\{$M$\}$$\}$], and [{$\alpha$} /$\{$$\{$M$\}$$\}$]. We apply the model
to 450,000 giants in LAMOST DR2 that have not been observed by APOGEE.
This demonstrates that precise individual abundances can be measured
from low-resolution spectra and represents the largest catalog to date
of homogeneous stellar [$\{$$\{$C$\}$$\}$/$\{$$\{$M$\}$$\}$], [$\{$$\{$N$\}$$\}$/$\{$$\{$M$\}$$\}$], masses, and ages.
As a result, we greatly increase the number and sky coverage of stars
with mass and age estimates.

abundances in the Milky Way (MW) contains a wealth of information on
Galactic evolution over cosmic time. We use data on 14,699 red-clump
stars from the APOGEE survey, covering 4 $\{$kpc$\}${\lsim} R{\lsim} 15 $\{$kpc$\}$,
to determine the structure of mono-abundance populations
(MAPs){\mdash}stars in narrow bins in [{$\alpha$} /$\{$Fe$\}$] and
[$\{$Fe$\}$/$\{$$\{$H$\}$$\}$]{\mdash}accounting for the complex effects of the APOGEE
selection function and the spatially variable dust obscuration. We
determine that all MAPs with enhanced [{$\alpha$} /$\{$Fe$\}$] are centrally
concentrated and are well-described as exponentials with a scale length
of 2.2+/- 0.2 $\{$kpc$\}$ over the whole radial range of the disk. We discover
that the surface-density profiles of low-[{$\alpha$} /$\{$Fe$\}$] MAPs are
complex: they do not monotonically decrease outwards, but rather display
a peak radius ranging from {\ap} 5 to {\ap} 13 $\{$kpc$\}$ at low [$\{$Fe$\}$/$\{$$\{$H$\}$$\}$].
The extensive radial coverage of the data allows us to measure radial
trends in the thickness of each MAP. While high-[{$\alpha$} /$\{$Fe$\}$] MAPs
have constant scale heights, low-[{$\alpha$} /$\{$Fe$\}$] MAPs flare. We confirm,
now with high-precision abundances, previous results that each MAP
contains only a single vertical scale height and that low-[$\{$Fe$\}$/$\{$$\{$H$\}$$\}$],
low-[{$\alpha$} /$\{$Fe$\}$] and high-[$\{$Fe$\}$/$\{$$\{$H$\}$$\}$], high-[{$\alpha$} /$\{$Fe$\}$] MAPs
have intermediate ($\{$h$\}$$_{Z}${\ap} 300$\{$--$\}$600 $\{$pc$\}$) scale heights
that smoothly bridge the traditional thin- and thick-disk divide. That
the high-[{$\alpha$} /$\{$Fe$\}$], thick disk components do not flare is strong
evidence against their thickness being caused by radial migration. The
correspondence between the radial structure and chemical-enrichment age
of stellar populations is clear confirmation of the inside-out growth of
galactic disks. The details of these relations will constrain the
variety of physical conditions under which stars form throughout the MW
disk.

of the solar granulation have been applied to Fe i and Fe ii line
formation. In contrast to classical analyses based on hydrostatic 1D
model atmospheres the procedure contains no adjustable free parameters
but the treatment of the numerical viscosity in the construction of the
3D, time-dependent, inhomogeneous model atmosphere and the elemental
abundance in the 3D spectral synthesis. However, the numerical viscosity
is introduced purely for numerical stability purposes and is determined
from standard hydrodynamical test cases with no adjustments allowed to
improve the agreement with the observational constraints from the solar
granulation. The non-thermal line broadening is mainly provided by the
Doppler shifts arising from the convective flows in the solar
photosphere and the solar oscillations. The almost perfect agreement
between the predicted temporally and spatially averaged line profiles
for weak Fe lines with the observed profiles and the absence of trends
in derived abundances with line strengths, seem to imply that the micro-
and macroturbulence concepts are obsolete in these 3D analyses.
Furthermore, the theoretical line asymmetries and shifts show a very
satisfactory agreement with observations with an accuracy of typically
50-100 m s$^{-1}$ on an absolute velocity scale. The remaining
minor discrepancies point to how the convection simulations can be
refined further.

	Abstract = {{Context. To derive space velocities of stars along the line of sight
from wavelength shifts in stellar spectra requires accounting for a
number of second-order effects. For most stars, gravitational redshifts,
convective blueshifts, and transverse stellar motion are the dominant
contributors. <BR /> Aims: We provide theoretical corrections for the
net velocity shifts due to convection expected for the measurements from
the Gaia Radial Velocity Spectrometer (RVS). <BR /> Methods: We used a
set of three-dimensional time-dependent simulations of stellar surface
convection computed with CO5BOLD to calculate spectra of late-type stars
in the Gaia RVS range and to infer the net velocity offset that
convective motions will induce in radial velocities derived by
cross-correlation. <BR /> Results: The net velocity shifts derived by
cross-correlation depend both on the wavelength range and spectral
resolution of the observations. Convective shifts for Gaia RVS
observations are less than 0.1 km s$^{-1}$ for late-K-type stars,
and they increase with stellar mass, reaching about 0.3 km
s$^{-1}$ or more for early F-type dwarfs. This tendency is the
result of an increase with effective temperature in both temperature and
velocity fluctuations in the line-forming region. Our simulations also
indicate that the net RVS convective shifts can be positive (i.e.
redshifts) in some cases. Overall, the blueshifts weaken slightly with
increasing surface gravity, and are enhanced at low metallicity.
Gravitational redshifts amount to 0.7 km s$^{-1}$ and dominate
convective blueshifts for dwarfs, but become much weaker for giants.

cosmology. 4MOST will in particular provide the spectroscopic
complements to the large area surveys coming from space missions like
Gaia, eROSITA, Euclid, and PLATO and from ground-based facilities like
VISTA, VST, DES, LSST and SKA. The 4MOST baseline concept features a 2.5
degree diameter field-of-view with \~{}2400 fibres in the focal surface
that are configured by a fibre positioner based on the tilting spine
principle. The fibres feed two types of spectrographs; \~{}1600 fibres go
to two spectrographs with resolution R$\lt$5000 ({$\lambda$}\~{}390-930 nm) and
\~{}800 fibres to a spectrograph with R$\gt$18,000 ({$\lambda$}\~{}392-437 nm and
515-572 nm and 605-675 nm). Both types of spectrographs are
fixed-configuration, three-channel spectrographs. 4MOST will have an
unique operations concept in which 5 year public surveys from both the
consortium and the ESO community will be combined and observed in
parallel during each exposure, resulting in more than 25 million spectra
of targets spread over a large fraction of the southern sky. The 4MOST
Facility Simulator (4FS) was developed to demonstrate the feasibility of
this observing concept. 4MOST has been accepted for implementation by
ESO with operations expected to start by the end of 2020. This paper
provides a top-level overview of the 4MOST facility, while other papers
in these proceedings provide more detailed descriptions of the
instrument concept[1], the instrument requirements development[2], the
systems engineering implementation[3], the instrument model[4], the
fibre positioner concepts[5], the fibre feed[6], and the
spectrographs[7].

	Abstract = {{The GAIA astrometric mission has recently been approved as one of the
next two ``cornerstones'' of ESA's science programme, with a launch date
target of not later than mid-2012. GAIA will provide positional and
radial velocity measurements with the accuracies needed to produce a
stereoscopic and kinematic census of about one billion stars throughout
our Galaxy (and into the Local Group), amounting to about 1 percent of
the Galactic stellar population. GAIA's main scientific goal is to
clarify the origin and history of our Galaxy, from a quantitative census
of the stellar populations. It will advance questions such as when the
stars in our Galaxy formed, when and how it was assembled, and its
distribution of dark matter. The survey aims for completeness to V=20
mag, with accuracies of about 10 mu as at 15 mag. Combined with
astrophysical information for each star, provided by on-board
multi-colour photometry and (limited) spectroscopy, these data will have
the precision necessary to quantify the early formation, and subsequent
dynamical, chemical and star formation evolution of our Galaxy.
Additional products include detection and orbital classification of tens
of thousands of extra-Solar planetary systems, and a comprehensive
survey of some 10$^{5}$-10$^{6}$ minor bodies in our Solar
System, through galaxies in the nearby Universe, to some 500 000 distant
quasars. It will provide a number of stringent new tests of general
relativity and cosmology. The complete satellite system was evaluated as
part of a detailed technology study, including a detailed payload
design, corresponding accuracy assesments, and results from a prototype
data reduction development.

@article{Rauer2014,
	Abstract = {{PLATO 2.0 has recently been selected for ESA's M3 launch opportunity
(2022/24). Providing accurate key planet parameters (radius, mass,
density and age) in statistical numbers, it addresses fundamental
questions such as: How do planetary systems form and evolve? Are there
other systems with planets like ours, including potentially habitable
planets? The PLATO 2.0 instrument consists of 34 small aperture
telescopes (32 with 25 s readout cadence and 2 with 2.5 s candence)
providing a wide field-of-view (2232 deg $^{2}$) and a large
photometric magnitude range (4-16 mag). It focusses on bright (4-11 mag)
stars in wide fields to detect and characterize planets down to
Earth-size by photometric transits, whose masses can then be determined
by ground-based radial-velocity follow-up measurements. Asteroseismology
will be performed for these bright stars to obtain highly accurate
stellar parameters, including masses and ages. The combination of bright
targets and asteroseismology results in high accuracy for the bulk
planet parameters: 2 \%, 4-10 \% and 10 \% for planet radii, masses and
ages, respectively. The planned baseline observing strategy includes two
long pointings (2-3 years) to detect and bulk characterize planets
reaching into the habitable zone (HZ) of solar-like stars and an
additional step-and-stare phase to cover in total about 50 \% of the sky.
PLATO 2.0 will observe up to 1,000,000 stars and detect and characterize
hundreds of small planets, and thousands of planets in the Neptune to
gas giant regime out to the HZ. It will therefore provide the first
large-scale catalogue of bulk characterized planets with accurate radii,
masses, mean densities and ages. This catalogue will include terrestrial
planets at intermediate orbital distances, where surface temperatures
are moderate. Coverage of this parameter range with statistical numbers
of bulk characterized planets is unique to PLATO 2.0. The PLATO 2.0
catalogue allows us to e.g.: - complete our knowledge of planet
diversity for low-mass objects, - correlate the planet mean
density-orbital distance distribution with predictions from planet
formation theories,- constrain the influence of planet migration and
scattering on the architecture of multiple systems, and - specify how
planet and system parameters change with host star characteristics, such
as type, metallicity and age. The catalogue will allow us to study
planets and planetary systems at different evolutionary phases. It will
further provide a census for small, low-mass planets. This will serve to
identify objects which retained their primordial hydrogen atmosphere and
in general the typical characteristics of planets in such low-mass,
low-density range. Planets detected by PLATO 2.0 will orbit bright stars
and many of them will be targets for future atmosphere spectroscopy
exploring their atmosphere. Furthermore, the mission has the potential
to detect exomoons, planetary rings, binary and Trojan planets. The
planetary science possible with PLATO 2.0 is complemented by its impact
on stellar and galactic science via asteroseismology as well as light
curves of all kinds of variable stars, together with observations of
stellar clusters of different ages. This will allow us to improve
stellar models and study stellar activity. A large number of well-known
ages from red giant stars will probe the structure and evolution of our
Galaxy. Asteroseismic ages of bright stars for different phases of
stellar evolution allow calibrating stellar age-rotation relationships.
Together with the results of ESA's Gaia mission, the results of PLATO
2.0 will provide a huge legacy to planetary, stellar and galactic
science.

	Abstract = {{The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) will search for planets
transiting bright and nearby stars. TESS has been selected by NASA for
launch in 2017 as an Astrophysics Explorer mission. The spacecraft will
be placed into a highly elliptical 13.7-day orbit around the Earth.
During its 2-year mission, TESS will employ four wide-field optical
charge-coupled device cameras to monitor at least 200,000 main-sequence
dwarf stars with I$_{C}${\ap}4-13 for temporary drops in brightness
caused by planetary transits. Each star will be observed for an interval
ranging from 1 month to 1 year, depending mainly on the star's ecliptic
latitude. The longest observing intervals will be for stars near the
ecliptic poles, which are the optimal locations for follow-up
observations with the James Webb Space Telescope. Brightness
measurements of preselected target stars will be recorded every 2 min,
and full frame images will be recorded every 30 min. TESS stars will be
10 to 100 times brighter than those surveyed by the pioneering Kepler
mission. This will make TESS planets easier to characterize with
follow-up observations. TESS is expected to find more than a thousand
planets smaller than Neptune, including dozens that are comparable in
size to the Earth. Public data releases will occur every 4 months,
inviting immediate community-wide efforts to study the new planets. The
TESS legacy will be a catalog of the nearest and brightest stars hosting
transiting planets, which will endure as highly favorable targets for
detailed investigations.

	Abstract = {{The SDSS-III/Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment
(APOGEE) survey operated from 2011-2014 using the APOGEE
spectrograph, which collects high-resolution (R {\tilde} 22,500), near-IR
(1.51-1.70 {$\mu$}m) spectra with a multiplexing (300 fiber-fed
objects) capability. We describe the survey data products that are
publicly available, which include catalogs with radial velocity, stellar
parameters, and 15 elemental abundances for over 150,000 stars, as well
as the more than 500,000 spectra from which these quantities are
derived. Calibration relations for the stellar parameters
($\{$T$\}$$_{{eff}$$\}$, $\{$log$\}$ g, [M/H], [{$\alpha$}/M]) and abundances (C, N,
O, Na, Mg, Al, Si, S, K, Ca, Ti, V, Mn, Fe, Ni) are presented and
discussed. The internal scatter of the abundances within clusters
indicates that abundance precision is generally between 0.05 and 0.09
dex across a broad temperature range; it is smaller for some elemental
abundances within more limited ranges and at high signal-to-noise ratio.
We assess the accuracy of the abundances using comparison of mean
cluster metallicities with literature values, APOGEE observations of the
solar spectrum and of Arcturus, comparison of individual star abundances
with other measurements, and consideration of the locus of derived
parameters and abundances of the entire sample, and find that it is
challenging to determine the absolute abundance scale; external accuracy
may be good to 0.1-0.2 dex. Uncertainties may be larger at cooler
temperatures ($\{$T$\}$$_{{eff}$$\}$  $\backslash$lt  4000 $\{$$\{$K$\}$$\}$). Access to the
public data release and data products is described, and some guidance
for using the data products is provided.

	Abstract = {{The Sloan Digital Sky Survey III's Apache Point Observatory Galactic
Evolution Experiment (APOGEE) is a high-resolution near-infrared
spectroscopic survey covering all of the major components of the Galaxy,
including the dust-obscured regions of the inner Milky Way disk and
bulge. Here we present a sample of 10,341 likely red-clump stars (RC)
from the first two years of APOGEE operations, selected based on their
position in color-metallicity-surface-gravity-effective-temperature
space using a new method calibrated using stellar evolution models and
high-quality asteroseismology data. The narrowness of the RC locus in
color-metallicity-luminosity space allows us to assign distances to the
stars with an accuracy of 5\%-10\%. The sample extends to typical
distances of about 3 kpc from the Sun, with some stars out to 8 kpc, and
spans a volume of approximately 100 kpc$^{3}$ over 5 kpc $\lt$\~{} R
$\lt$\~{} 14 kpc, |Z| $\lt$\~{} 2 kpc, and -15{\deg} $\lt$\~{} Galactocentric
azimuth $\lt$\~{} 30{\deg}. The APOGEE red-clump (APOGEE-RC) catalog contains
photometry from the Two Micron All Sky Survey, reddening estimates,
distances, line-of-sight velocities, stellar parameters and elemental
abundances determined from the high-resolution APOGEE spectra, and
matches to major proper motion catalogs. We determine the survey
selection function for this data set and discuss how the RC selection
samples the underlying stellar populations. We use this sample to limit
any azimuthal variations in the median metallicity within the
{\ap}45{\deg} azimuthal region covered by the current sample to be
$\lt$=0.02 dex, which is more than an order of magnitude smaller than the
radial metallicity gradient. This result constrains coherent
non-axisymmetric flows within a few kiloparsecs from the Sun.

@article{Casagrande2014b,
	Abstract = {{The apparent size of stars is a crucial benchmark for fundamental
stellar properties such as effective temperatures, radii and surface
gravities. While interferometric measurements of stellar angular
diameters are the most direct method to gauge these, they are still
limited to relatively nearby and bright stars, which are saturated in
most of the modern photometric surveys. This dichotomy prevents us from
safely extending well-calibrated relations to the faint stars targeted
in large spectroscopic and photometric surveys. Here, we alleviate this
obstacle by presenting South African Astronomical Observatory
near-infrared JHK observations of 55 stars: 16 of them have
interferometric angular diameters and the rest are in common with the 2
Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS, unsaturated) data set, allowing us to tie
the effective temperatures and angular diameters derived via the
infrared flux method to the interferometric scale. We extend the test to
recent interferometric measurements of unsaturated 2MASS stars,
including giants, and the metal-poor benchmark target HD122563. With a
critical evaluation of the systematics involved, we conclude that a 1
per cent accuracy in fundamental stellar parameters is usually within
reach. Caution, however, must be used when indirectly testing a
T$_{eff}$ scale via colour relations as well as when assessing the
reliability of interferometric measurements, especially at
submilliarcsec level. As a result, rather different effective
temperature scales can be compatible with a given subset of
interferometric data. We highlight some caveats to be aware of in such a
quest and suggest a simple method to check against systematics in
fundamental measurements. A new diagnostic combination seismic radii
with astrometric distances is also presented.

@article{Ting2018,
	Abstract = {{Oxygen is the most abundant ``metal'' element in stars and in the cosmos.
But determining oxygen abundances in stars has proven challenging,
because of the shortage of detectable atomic oxygen lines in their
optical spectra as well as observational and theoretical complications
with these lines (e.g., blends, 3D, non-LTE). Nonetheless, Ting et al.
(2017) were recently able to demonstrate that oxygen abundances can be
determined from low-resolution (R$\simeq$2000) optical spectra. Here we
investigate the physical processes that enable such a measurement for
cool stars, such as K-giants. We show that the strongest spectral
diagnostics of oxygen come from the CNO atomic-molecular network, but
are manifested in spectral features that do not involve oxygen. In the
outer atmosphere layers most of the carbon is locked up in CO, and
changes to the oxygen abundance directly affect the abundances of all
other carbon-bearing molecules, thereby changing the strength of CH, CN,
and C$\_2$ features across the optical spectrum. In deeper atmosphere
layers most of the carbon is in atomic form, and any change in the
oxygen abundance has little effect on the other carbon-bearing
molecules. The key physical effect enabling such oxygen abundance
measurements is that spectral features in the optical arise from both
the CO-dominant and the atomic carbon-dominant regions, providing
non-degenerate constraints on both C and O. Beyond the case at hand, the
results show that physically sound abundances measurements need not be
limited to those elements that have observable lines themselves.

identified 41 cluster members, and yielded an overall metallicity of
[$\{$Fe$\}$/$\{$H$\}$]=-0.13{\plusmn} 0.13 and barycentric radial velocity of
v$_{r}$ = 58.30 {\plusmn} 0.22 km s$^{-1}$. These kinematics

cluster. Combining the spatial and kinematic data we calculate Gaia 1
has a circular orbit with a radius of about 12 kpc, but with a large out
of plane motion: z\_$\{$max$\}$=1.1\^{}$\{$+0.4$\}$\_$\{$-0.3$\}$ kpc. Clusters with such

	Abstract = {{We present a large set of theoretical isochrones, whose distinctive
features mostly reside on the greatly-improved treatment of the
thermally-pulsing asymptotic giant branch (TP-AGB) phase. Essentially,
we have coupled the TP-AGB tracks described in Paper I, at their stages
of pre-flash quiescent H-shell burning, with the evolutionary tracks for
the previous evolutionary phases from Girardi et al. (2000, A{\amp}AS,
141, 371). Theoretical isochrones for any intermediate value of age and
metallicity are then derived by interpolation in the grids. We take care
that the isochrones keep, to a good level of detail, the several
peculiarities present in these TP-AGB tracks - e.g., the cool tails of
C-type stars owing to the use of proper molecular opacities as
convective dredge-up occurs along the TP-AGB; the bell-shaped sequences
in the Hertzsprung-Russell (HR) diagram for stars with hot-bottom
burning; the changes of pulsation mode between fundamental and first
overtone; the sudden changes of mean mass-loss rates as the surface
chemistry changes from M- to C-type; etc. Theoretical isochrones are
then converted to about 20 different photometric systems - including
traditional ground-based systems, and those of recent major wide-field
surveys such as SDSS, OGLE, DENIS, 2MASS, UKIDSS, etc., - by means of
synthetic photometry applied to an updated library of stellar spectra,
suitably extended to include C-type stars. Finally, we correct the
predicted photometry for the effect of circumstellar dust during the
mass-losing stages of the AGB evolution, which allows us to improve the
results for the optical-to-infrared systems, and to simulate mid- and
far-IR systems such as those of Spitzer and AKARI. We illustrate the
most striking properties of these isochrones by means of basic
comparisons with observational data for the Milky Way disc and the
Magellanic Clouds. Access to the data is provided both via a web
repository of static tables (http://stev.oapd.inaf.it/dustyAGB07 and
CDS), and via an interactive web interface
(http://stev.oapd.inaf.it/cmd), which provides tables for any
intermediate value of age and metallicity, for several photometric
systems, and for different choices of dust properties.

Iglesias et al. (1992). In addition to this we present another set with
chemical composition [Z=0.001, Y=0.23] based on models calculated with
the radiative opacities by Huebner et al. (1977). All the stellar models
are followed from the zero age main sequence (ZAMS) to the central
carbon ignition for massive stars or to the beginning of the thermally
pulsing regime of the asymptotic giant branch phase (TP-AGB) for low and
intermediate mass stars. For each isochrone, we give the current mass,
effective temperatures, bolometric and visual magnitudes, (U-B), (B-V),
(V-R), (V-I), (V-J), (V-H), and (V-K) colors, and the luminosity
function for the case of the Salpeter law. In addition to this,
integrated magnitudes and colors at several characteristic points are
also presented together with the mass of the remnant star when
appropriate. The main characteristic that makes this set of isochrones
very valuable is based on their extension in mass and chemical
composition, besides the calculation of late stages of evolution, beyond
the red giant tip till the white dwarf stage after the planetary nebula
phase.

agreement with Hipparcos results and the observed rotation curve.
Constraints are posed on the outer bulge structure, the warped and

tuned to produce reliable predictions in the visible and the
near-infrared in wide photometric bands from U to K. Finally, we
describe applications such as photometric and astrometric simulations
and a new classification tool based on a Bayesian probability estimator,
which could be used in the framework of Virtual Observatories. As

	Abstract = {{We present here a fast code for creating a synthetic survey of the Milky
Way. Given one or more color-magnitude bounds, a survey size, and
geometry, the code returns a catalog of stars in accordance with a given
model of the Milky Way. The model can be specified by a set of density
distributions or as an N-body realization. We provide fast and efficient
algorithms for sampling both types of models. As compared to earlier
sampling schemes which generate stars at specified locations along a
line of sight, our scheme can generate a continuous and smooth
distribution of stars over any given volume. The code is quite general
and flexible and can accept input in the form of a star formation rate,
age-metallicity relation, age-velocity-dispersion relation, and analytic
density distribution functions. Theoretical isochrones are then used to
generate a catalog of stars, and support is available for a wide range
of photometric bands. As a concrete example, we implement the
Besan{\c c}on Milky Way model for the disk. For the stellar halo we
employ the simulated stellar halo N-body models of Bullock {\amp}
Johnston. In order to sample N-body models, we present a scheme that
disperses the stars spawned by an N-body particle, in such a way that
the phase-space density of the spawned stars is consistent with that of
the N-body particles. The code is ideally suited to generating synthetic
data sets that mimic near future wide area surveys such as GAIA, LSST,
and HERMES. As an application we study the prospect of identifying
structures in the stellar halo with a simulated GAIA survey. We plan to
make the code publicly available.

	Abstract = {{The fourth United States Naval Observatory (USNO) CCD Astrograph
Catalog, UCAC4, was released in 2012 August (double-sided DVD and CDS
data center Vizier catalog I/322). It is the final release in this
series and contains over 113 million objects; over 105 million of them
with proper motions (PMs). UCAC4 is an updated version of UCAC3 with
about the same number of stars also covering all-sky. Bugs were fixed,
Schmidt plate survey data were avoided, and precise five-band photometry
was added for about half the stars. Astrograph observations have been
supplemented for bright stars by FK6, Hipparcos, and Tycho-2 data to
compile a UCAC4 star catalog complete from the brightest stars to about
magnitude R = 16. Epoch 1998-2004 positions are obtained from
observations with the 20 cm aperture USNO Astrograph's ``red lens,''
equipped with a 4k by 4k CCD. Mean positions and PMs are derived by
combining these observations with over 140 ground- and space-based
catalogs, including Hipparcos/Tycho and the AC2000.2, as well as
unpublished measures of over 5000 plates from other astrographs. For
most of the faint stars in the southern hemisphere, the first epoch
plates from the Southern Proper Motion program form the basis for PMs,
while the Northern Proper Motion first epoch plates serve the same
purpose for the rest of the sky. These data are supplemented by 2MASS
near-IR photometry for about 110 million stars and five-band (B, V, g,
r, i) APASS data for over 51 million stars. Thus the published UCAC4, as
were UCAC3 and UCAC2, is a compiled catalog with the UCAC observational
program being a major component. The positional accuracy of stars in
UCAC4 at mean epoch is about 15-100 mas per coordinate, depending on
magnitude, while the formal errors in PMs range from about 1 to 10 mas
yr$^{-1}$ depending on magnitude and observing history.
Systematic errors in PMs are estimated to be about 1-4 mas
yr$^{-1}$.

Landolt BV and Sloan g'r'i' bands for all 425,743 stars included in the
fourth RAVE Data Release. The internal accuracy of the APASS photometry
of RAVE stars, expressed as the error of the mean of data obtained and
separately calibrated over a median of four distinct observing epochs
and distributed between 2009 and 2013, is 0.013, 0.012, 0.012, 0.014,
and 0.021 mag for the B, V, g', r', and i' bands, respectively. The
equally high external accuracy of APASS photometry has been verified on
secondary Landolt and Sloan photometric standard stars not involved in
the APASS calibration process and on a large body of literature data on
field and cluster stars, confirming the absence of offsets and trends.
Compared with the Carlsberg Meridian Catalog (CMC-15), APASS astrometry
of RAVE stars is accurate to a median value of 0.098 arcsec. Brightness
distribution functions for the RAVE stars have been derived in all
bands. APASS photometry of RAVE stars, augmented by 2MASS JHK infrared
data, has been {$\chi$}$^{2}$ fitted to a densely populated synthetic

	Abstract = {{Members of widely-separated stellar binaries ($\gt$ 0.1 pc) or loosely
bound stellar associations and clusters are born with small spreads in
kinematics and chemistry, but disrupt and dissociate on timescales
comparable to their orbital time within the Milky Way. The kinematic
properties of comoving star pairs---bound wide binaries or unbound but
coeval stars---are therefore sensitive to both the smooth tidal field
and gravitational perturbation spectrum of the Milky Way. In previous
work, we identified $\gt$4,000 candidate comoving pairs using only
astrometric data from the Tycho-Gaia Astrometric Solution (TGAS) catalog
and find a large number of pairs with separations $\gt$ 1 pc. Without
radial velocity measurements for the vast majority of these pairs, the
false-positive rate at these separations is significant (\~{}50\%). Here we
present results from our own low-resolution radial-velocity survey of a
random sample of the candidate pairs to identify and validate true
comoving star pairs. Of the 311 observed comoving pairs, we confirm 127
comoving pairs with separations as large as \~{}10 pc, our original search
limit. Between separations of 0.001 pc to \~{}0.5 pc, the number of
confirmed pairs per separation decreases with increasing separation
(number per log separation is uniform). From \~{}0.5 pc to 10 pc, the
number per separation is approximately uniform (number per log
separation increases). We confirm the discovery of a population of
comoving star pairs at very large separations, suggesting that disrupted
wide binaries and stellar associations remain approximately spatially
coherent.

	Abstract = {{We develop a data-driven spectral model for identifying and
characterizing spatially unresolved multiple-star systems and apply it
to APOGEE DR13 spectra of main-sequence stars. Binaries and triples are
identified as targets whose spectra can be significantly better fit by a
superposition of two or three model spectra, drawn from the same
isochrone, than any single-star model. From an initial sample of
{\tilde}20 000 main-sequence targets, we identify {\tilde}2500 binaries in
which both the primary and secondary stars contribute detectably to the
spectrum, simultaneously fitting for the velocities and stellar
parameters of both components. We additionally identify and fit
{\tilde}200 triple systems, as well as {\tilde}700 velocity-variable
systems in which the secondary does not contribute detectably to the
spectrum. Our model simplifies the process of simultaneously fitting
single- or multi-epoch spectra with composite models and does not depend
on a velocity offset between the two components of a binary, making it
sensitive to traditionally undetectable systems with periods of hundreds
or thousands of years. In agreement with conventional expectations,
almost all the spectrally identified binaries with measured parallaxes
fall above the main sequence in the colour-magnitude diagram. We find
excellent agreement between spectrally and dynamically inferred mass
ratios for the {\tilde}600 binaries in which a dynamical mass ratio can
be measured from multi-epoch radial velocities. We obtain full orbital
solutions for 64 systems, including 14 close binaries within
hierarchical triples. We make available catalogues of stellar
parameters, abundances, mass ratios, and orbital parameters.

includes a detailed treatment of the thermally pulsing asymptotic giant
branch (TP-AGB) phase, covering a wide range of initial metallicities
(0.0001 $\lt$ Z$_{I}$ $\lt$ 0.06). Compared to previous releases,
the main novelties and improvements are use of new TP-AGB tracks and
related atmosphere models and spectra for M and C-type stars; inclusion
of the surface H+He+CNO abundances in the isochrone tables, accounting
for the effects of diffusion, dredge-up episodes and hot-bottom burning;
inclusion of complete thermal pulse cycles, with a complete description
of the in-cycle changes in the stellar parameters; new pulsation models
to describe the long-period variability in the fundamental and
first-overtone modes; and new dust models that follow the growth of the
grains during the AGB evolution, in combination with radiative transfer
calculations for the reprocessing of the photospheric emission. Overall,
these improvements are expected to lead to a more consistent and
detailed description of properties of TP-AGB stars expected in resolved
stellar populations, especially in regard to their mean photometric
properties from optical to mid-infrared wavelengths. We illustrate the
expected numbers of TP-AGB stars of different types in stellar
populations covering a wide range of ages and initial metallicities,
providing further details on the {\ldquo}C-star island{\rdquo} that
appears at intermediate values of age and metallicity, and about the
AGB-boosting effect that occurs at ages close to 1.6-Gyr for populations
of all metallicities. The isochrones are available through a new

	Abstract = {{In the era of industrial Galactic astronomy and multi-object
spectroscopic stellar surveys, the sample sizes and the number of
available stellar chemical abundances have reached dimensions in which
it has become difficult to process all the available information in an
effective manner. In this paper we demonstrate the use of a
dimensionality-reduction technique (t-distributed stochastic neighbour
embedding, t-SNE) for analysing the stellar abundance-space
distribution. While the non-parametric non-linear behaviour of this
technique makes it difficult to estimate the significance of found
abundance-space substructure, we show that our results depend little on
parameter choices and are robust to abundance errors. By reanalysing the
high-resolution high-signal-to-noise solar-neighbourhood HARPS-GTO
sample with t-SNE, we find clearer chemical separations of the high- and
low-[$\alpha$/Fe] disc sequences, hints for multiple populations in the
high-[$\alpha$/Fe] population, and indications that the chemical
evolution of the high-[$\alpha$/Fe] metal-rich stars is connected with
the super-metal-rich stars. We also identify a number of chemically
peculiar stars, among them the intermediate-age, extremely [Ti/Fe]-rich
star HD14452, and a high-confidence s-process-enhanced abundance-ratio
pair (HD91345/HD126681) with very similar ages and $v\_X$ and $v\_Y$
velocities, which we suggest to have a common birth origin, possibly a
merged dwarf galaxy. Our results demonstrate the potential of t-SNE and
similar methods for chemical-tagging studies of large spectroscopic
surveys.

role for several topical issues in astrophysics. Examples include
studying the chemical structure and evolution of the Milky Way Galaxy,
tracing the origin of chemical elements, and characterizing planetary
host stars. Data are accumulating from instruments that obtain
high-quality spectra of stars in the ultraviolet, optical and infrared
wavelength regions on a routine basis. These instruments are located at
ground-based 2-10 m class telescopes around the world, in addition
to the spectrographs with unique capabilities available at the Hubble
Space Telescope. The interpretation of these spectra requires
high-quality transition data for numerous species, in particular neutral
and singly ionized atoms, and di- or triatomic molecules. We rely
heavily on the continuous efforts of laboratory astrophysics groups that
produce and improve the relevant experimental and theoretical atomic and
molecular data. The compilation of the best available data is
facilitated by databases and electronic infrastructures such as the NIST
Atomic Spectra Database, the VALD database, or the Virtual Atomic and
Molecular Data Centre. We illustrate the current status of atomic data
for optical stellar spectra with the example of the Gaia-ESO Public
Spectroscopic Survey. Data sources for 35 chemical elements were
reviewed in an effort to construct a line list for a homogeneous
abundance analysis of up to 10$^{5}$ stars.

parallax-based M\_K serves as an additional constraint on the derived
quantities, especially when systematic errors in stellar parameters are
underestimated. We reconstructed the age-metallicity relationship in the
solar neighbourhood by re-analysing the Geneva-Copenhagen Survey with
the inclusion of TGAS-parallaxes and initial bulk metallicity sampling.
We found a flat trend for disk stars with ages $\lt$11 Gyr but with

	Abstract = {{<BR /> Aims: Previous studies have found that the Galactic rotation
velocity-metallicity (V-[Fe/H]) relations for the thin and thick disk
populations show negative and positive slopes, respectively. The first
Gaia data release includes the Tycho-Gaia Astrometric Solution (TGAS)
information, which we use to analyze the V-[Fe/H] relation for a
strictly selected sample with high enough astrometric accuracy. We aim
to present an explanation for the slopes of the V-[Fe/H] relationship.
<BR /> Methods: We have identified a sample of stars with accurate Gaia
TGAS data and SDSS APOGEE [{$\alpha$}/Fe] and [Fe/H] measurements. We
measured the V-[Fe/H] relation for thin and thick disk stars classified
on the basis of their [{$\alpha$}/Fe] and [Fe/H] abundances. <BR />
Results: We find dV/ d [Fe/H] = -18 {\plusmn} 2 km s$^{-1}$
dex$^{-1}$ for stars in the thin disk and dV/ d [Fe/H] = +23
{\plusmn} 10 km s$^{-1}$ dex$^{-1}$ for thick disk stars, and
thus we confirm the different signs for the slopes. The negative value
of dV/d[Fe/H] for thin disk stars is consistent with previous work, but
the combination of TGAS and APOGEE data provides higher precision, even
though systematic errors could exceed {\plusmn}5 km s$^{-1}$
dex$^{-1}$. Our average measurement of dV/d[Fe/H] for local thick
disk stars shows a somewhat flatter slope than in previous studies, but
we confirm a significant spread and a dependence of the slope on the
[{$\alpha$}/Fe] ratio of the stars. Using a simple N-body model, we
demonstrate that the observed trends for the thick and thin disk can be
explained by the measured radial metallicity gradients and the
correlation between orbital eccentricity and metallicity in the thick
disk. <BR /> Conclusions: We conclude that the V-[Fe/H] relation for
thin disk stars is well determined from our TGAS-APOGEE sample, and a
direct consequence of the radial metallicity gradient and the
correlation between Galactic rotation and mean Galactocentric distance.
Stars formed farther away from the solar circle tend to be near their
orbital pericenter, showing larger velocities and on average lower
metallicities, while those closer to the Galactic center are usually
closer to their orbital apocenter, therefore moving slower and with
higher metallicities. The positive dV/d[Fe/H] for the thick disk sample
is likely connected to the correlation between orbital eccentricity and
metallicity for that population.

	Abstract = {{Context. The velocity distribution of stars in the solar neighbourhood
is inhomogeneous and rich with stellar streams and kinematic structures.
These may retain important clues regarding the formation and dynamical
history of the Milky Way. However, the nature and origin of many of the
streams and structures is unclear, hindering our understanding of how
the Milky Way formed and evolved. <BR /> Aims: We aim to study the
velocity distribution of stars of the solar neighbourhood and
investigate the properties of individual kinematic structures in order
to improve our understanding of their origins. <BR /> Methods: Using the
astrometric data provided by Gaia DR1/TGAS and radial velocities from
RAVE DR5 we perform a wavelet analysis with the {\`a} trous algorithm
of 55 831 stars that have U and V velocity uncertainties less than 4 km
s$^{-1}$. An auto-convolution histogram method is used to filter
the output data, and we then run Monte Carlo simulations to verify that
the detected structures are real and are not caused by noise due to
velocity uncertainties. Additionally we analysed our stellar sample by
splitting all stars into a nearby sample ($\lt$300 pc) and a distant
sample ($\gt$300 pc), and two chemically defined samples that to a first
degree represent the thin and the thick disks. <BR /> Results: We detect
19 kinematic structures in the solar neighbourhood in the range of
scales 3-16 km s$^{-1}$ at the 3{$\sigma$} confidence level. Among
them we identified well-known groups (such as Hercules, Sirius, Coma
Berenices, Pleiades, and Wolf 630), confirmed recently detected groups
(such as Antoja12 and Bobylev16), and detected a new structure at (U,V)
{\ap} (37,8) km s$^{-1}$. Another three new groups are tentatively
detected, but require further confirmation. Some of the detected groups
show clear dependence on distance in the sense that they are only
present in the nearby sample ($\lt$300 pc), and others appear to be
correlated with chemistry as they are only present in one of the
chemically defined thin and thick disk samples. <BR /> Conclusions: With
the much enlarged stellar sample and much increased precision in
distances and proper motions, provided by Gaia DR1/TGAS we have shown
that the velocity distribution of stars in the solar neighbourhood
contains more structures than previously known. A new feature is
discovered and three recently detected groups are confirmed at high
confidence level. Dividing the sample based on distance and/or
metallicity shows that there are variety of structures which form
large-scale and small-scale groups; some of them have clear trends on
metallicities, others are a mixture of both disk stars. Based on these
findings we discuss possible origins of each group.

	Abstract = {{Context. The hierarchical structure formation model predicts that
stellar halos should form, at least partly, via mergers. If this was a
predominant formation channel for the Milky Way's halo, imprints of this
merger history in the form of moving groups or streams should also exist
in the vicinity of the Sun. <BR /> Aims: We study the kinematics of halo
stars in the Solar neighbourhood using the very recent first data
release from the Gaia mission, and in particular the TGAS dataset, in
combination with data from the RAVE survey. Our aim is to determine the
amount of substructure present in the phase-space distribution of halo
stars that could be linked to merger debris. <BR /> Methods: To
characterise kinematic substructure, we measured the velocity
correlation function in our sample of halo (low-metallicity) stars. We
also studied the distribution of these stars in the space of energy and
two components of the angular momentum, in what we call ``integrals of
motion'' space. <BR /> Results: The velocity correlation function reveals
substructure in the form of an excess of pairs of stars with similar
velocities, well above that expected for a smooth distribution.
Comparison to cosmological simulations of the formation of stellar halos
indicates that the levels found are consistent with the Galactic halo
having been built solely via accretion. Similarly, the distribution of
stars in the space of integrals of motion is highly complex. A
strikingly high fraction (from 58\% up to more than 73\%) of the stars
that are somewhat less bound than the Sun are on (highly) retrograde
orbits. A simple comparison to Milky Way-mass galaxies in cosmological
hydrodynamical simulations suggests that less than 1\% have such
prominently retrograde outer halos. We also identify several other
statistically significant structures in integrals of motion space that
could potentially be related to merger events.

	Abstract = {{Context. The pattern of chemical abundance ratios in stellar populations
of the Milky Way is a fingerprint of the Galactic chemical history. In
order to interpret such chemical fossils of Galactic archaeology,
chemical evolution models have to be developed. However, despite the
complex physics included in the most recent models, significant
discrepancies between models and observations are widely encountered.
<BR /> Aims: The aim of this paper is to characterise the abundance
patterns of five iron-peak elements (Mn, Fe, Ni, Cu, and Zn) for which
the stellar origin and chemical evolution are still debated. <BR />
Methods: We automatically derived iron peak (Mn, Fe, Ni, Cu, and Zn) and
{$\alpha$} element (Mg) chemical abundances for 4666 stars, adopting
classical LTE spectral synthesis and 1D atmospheric models. Our
observational data collection is composed of high-resolution, high
signal-to-noise ratios HARPS and FEROS spectra, which were previously
parametrised by the AMBRE project. <BR /> Results: We used the bimodal
distribution of the magnesium-to-iron abundance ratios to chemically
classify our sample stars into different Galactic substructures: thin
disc, metal-poor and high-{$\alpha$} metal rich, high-{$\alpha$}, and
low-{$\alpha$} metal-poor populations. Both high-{$\alpha$} and low-{$\alpha$}
metal-poor populations are fully distinct in Mg, Cu, and Zn, but these
substructures are statistically indistinguishable in Mn and Ni. Thin
disc trends of [Ni/Fe] and [Cu/Fe] are very similar and show a small
increase at supersolar metallicities. Also, both thin and thick disc
trends of Ni and Cu are very similar and indistinguishable. Yet, Mn
looks very different from Ni and Cu. [Mn/Fe] trends of thin and thick
discs actually have noticeable differences: the thin disc is slightly Mn
richer than the thick disc. The [Zn/Fe] trends look very similar to
those of [{$\alpha$}/Fe] trends. The typical dispersion of results in both
discs is low ({\ap}0.05 dex for [Mg, Mn, and Cu/Fe]) and is even much
lower for [Ni/Fe] ({\ap}0.035 dex). <BR /> Conclusions: It is clearly
demonstrated that Zn is an {$\alpha$}-like element and could be used to
separate thin and thick disc stars. Moreover, we show that the [Mn/Mg]
ratio could also be a very good tool for tagging Galactic substructures.
From the comparison with Galactic chemical evolutionary models, we
conclude that some recent models can partially reproduce the observed
Mg, Zn, and, Cu behaviours in thin and thick discs and metal-poor
sequences. Models mostly fail to reproduce Mn and Ni in all metallicity
domains, however, models adopting yields normalised from solar chemical
properties reproduce Mn and Ni better, suggesting that there is still a
lack of realistic theoretical yields of some iron-peak elements. The
very low scatter ({\ap}0.05 dex) in thin and thick disc sequences could
provide an observational constrain for Galactic evolutionary models that
study the efficiency of stellar radial migration.

	Abstract = {{We calculate the evolution of heavy-element abundances from C to Zn in
the solar neighborhood, adopting our new nucleosynthesis yields. Our
yields are calculated for wide ranges of metallicity
(Z=0-Z$_{solar}$) and the explosion energy (normal supernovae and
hypernovae), based on the light-curve and spectra fitting of individual
supernovae. The elemental abundance ratios are in good agreement with
observations. Among the {$\alpha$}-elements, O, Mg, Si, S, and Ca show a
plateau at [Fe/H]$\lt$\~{}-1, while Ti is underabundant overall. The
observed abundance of Zn ([Zn/Fe]\~{}0) can be explained only by the
high-energy explosion models, as it requires a large contribution of
hypernovae. The observed decrease in the odd-Z elements (Na, Al, and Cu)
toward low [Fe/H] is reproduced by the metallicity effect on
nucleosynthesis. The iron-peak elements (Cr, Mn, Co, and Ni) are
consistent with the observed mean values at -2.5$\lt$\~{}[Fe/H]$\lt$\~{}-1, and
the observed trend at the lower metallicity can be explained by the
energy effect. We also show the abundance ratios and the metallicity
distribution functions of the Galactic bulge, halo, and thick disk. Our
results suggest that the formation timescale of the thick disk is \~{}1-3

	Abstract = {{From ESO VLT/FLAMES/GIRAFFE spectra, abundance measurements of Zn have
been made in {\ap}100 individual red giant branch (RGB) stars in the
Sculptor dwarf spheroidal galaxy. This is the largest sample of
individual Zn abundance measurements within a stellar system beyond the
Milky Way. In the observed metallicity range, -2.7 {\le} [Fe/H] {\le}
-0.9, the general trend of Zn abundances in Sculptor is similar to that
of {$\alpha$}-elements. That is, super-solar abundance ratios of [Zn/Fe] at
low metallicities, which decrease with increasing [Fe/H], eventually
reaching subsolar values. However, at the higher metallicities in
Sculptor, [Fe/H] {\gsim} -1.8, we find a significant scatter, -0.8 {\lsim}
[Zn/Fe] {\lsim} +0.4, which is not seen in any {$\alpha$}-element. Our
results are consistent with previous observations of a limited number of
stars in Sculptor and in other dwarf galaxies. These results suggest
that zinc has a complex nucleosynthetic origin, behaving neither
completely like an {$\alpha$}- nor an iron-peak element.

	Abstract = {{Context. Current models of galaxy formation predict that the Galactic
halo was assembled hierarchically. By measuring abundance ratios in
stars it may be possible to identify substructures in the halo resulting
from this process. <BR /> Aims: A previous study of 94 dwarf stars with
-1.6 $\lt$ [Fe/H] $\lt$ -0.4 in the solar neighborhood has revealed the
existence of two distinct halo populations with a systematic difference
in [{$\alpha$}/Fe] at a given metallicity. In continuation of that work,
abundances of Mn, Cu, Zn, Y, and Ba are determined for the same sample
of stars. <BR /> Methods: Equivalent widths of atomic lines are measured
from high resolution VLT/UVES and NOT/FIES spectra and used to derive
abundance ratios from an LTE analysis based on MARCS model atmospheres.
The analysis is made relative to two thick-disk stars, <ASTROBJ>HD
22879</ASTROBJ> and <ASTROBJ>HD 76932</ASTROBJ>, such that very precise
differential values are obtained. <BR /> Results: Systematic differences
between the ``high-{$\alpha$}'' and ``low-{$\alpha$}'' halo populations are found
for [Cu/Fe], [Zn/Fe], and [Ba/Y], whereas there is no significant
difference in the case of [Mn/Fe]. At a given metallicity, [Cu/Fe] shows
a large scatter that is closely correlated with a corresponding scatter
in [Na/Fe] and [Ni/Fe]. <BR /> Conclusions: The metallicity trends of
[Cu/Fe], [Zn/Fe], and [Ba/Y] can be explained from existing
nucleosynthesis calculations if the high-{$\alpha$} stars formed in regions
with such a high star formation rate that only massive stars and type II
supernovae contributed to the chemical enrichment. The low-{$\alpha$}
stars, on the other hand, most likely originate from systems with a
slower chemical evolution, characterized by additional enrichment from
type Ia supernovae and low-mass AGB stars.

@article{Iwamoto1999,
	Abstract = {{The major uncertainties involved in the Chandrasekhar mass models for
Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) are related to the companion star of their
accreting white dwarf progenitor (which determines the accretion rate
and consequently the carbon ignition density) and the flame speed after
the carbon ignition. We calculate explosive nucleosynthesis in
relatively slow deflagrations with a variety of deflagration speeds and
ignition densities to put new constraints on the above key quantities.
The abundance of the Fe group, in particular of neutron-rich species
like $^{48}$Ca, $^{50}$Ti, $^{54}$Cr,
$^{54,58}$Fe, and $^{58}$Ni, is highly sensitive to the
electron captures taking place in the central layers. The yields
obtained from such a slow central deflagration, and from a fast
deflagration or delayed detonation in the outer layers, are combined and
put to comparison with solar isotopic abundances. To avoid excessively
large ratios of $^{54}$Cr/$^{56}$Fe and
$^{50}$Ti/$^{56}$Fe, the central density of the ''average''
white dwarf progenitor at ignition should be as low as
$\lt$\~{}2{\times}10$^{9}$ g cm$^{-3}$. To avoid the
overproduction of $^{58}$Ni and $^{54}$Fe, either the flame
speed should not exceed a few percent of the sound speed in the central
low Y$_{e}$ layers or the metallicity of the average progenitors
has to be lower than solar. Such low central densities can be realized
by a rapid accretion as fast as {\.M}$\gt$\~{}1{\times}10$^{-7}$
M$_{solar}$ yr$^{-1}$. In order to reproduce the solar
abundance of $^{48}$Ca, one also needs progenitor systems that
undergo ignition at higher densities. Even the smallest laminar flame
speeds after the low-density ignitions would not produce sufficient
amount of this isotope. We also found that the total amount of
$^{56}$Ni, the Si-Ca/Fe ratio, and the abundance of some elements
like Mn and Cr (originating from incomplete Si burning), depend on the
density of the deflagration-detonation transition in delayed
detonations. Our nucleosynthesis results favor transition densities
slightly below 2.2{\times}10$^{7}$ g cm$^{-3}$.

	Abstract = {{How did the Galactic disk form and can the sequence of events ever be
unravelled from the vast stellar inventory? This will require that some
of the residual inhomogeneities from prehistory escaped the dissipative
process at an early stage. Fossil hunting to date has concentrated
mostly on the stellar halo, but a key source of information will be the
thick disk. This is believed to be a `snap frozen' relic which formed
during or shortly after the last major epoch of dissipation, or it may
have formed from infalling systems early in the life of the Galaxy. As
part of the KAOS Galaxy Genesis project, we explore the early history of
the halo and the thick disk by looking for discrete substructures,
either due to infall or in situ star formation, through chemical
tagging. This will require high signal-to-noise echelle spectroscopy of
up to a million stars throughout the disk. Our program has a short-term
and a long-term goal. The short-term goal is to quantify the size and
structure of the multi-dimensional chemical abundance space (C-space)
for all major components of the Galaxy. We seek to establish how many
axes in (C-space) are decoupled and have large intrinsic dispersions. A
critical test of chemical tagging in the short term is that stellar
streams in the halo, identified from detailed phase space information,
are highly localised in (C-space), or are confined to chemical tracks.
These trajectories presuppose that stars form in a closed box through
progressive enrichments of the gas, leading to stars dispersed along a
narrow track in a complex chemical space. The long-term goal is to
identify unique chemical signatures in the thick disk, originating from
different formation sites, for star clusters which have long since
dispersed. This will require precise chemical abundances for heavy
elements such that a star can be localised to a discrete point in
(C-space). If the star clusters originally formed outside the Galaxy in
a bound infalling system, the stellar abundances may fall along a
chemical track, rather than a discrete point in (C-space).

Atomic transition probabilities have been critically evaluated and

our consideration of all available theoretical and experimental
literature sources. All ionization stages (except for hydrogenic) are
covered, and the data are presented in separate tables for each atom and
ion. Separate listings are given for ``allowed'' (electric dipole) and
``forbidden'' (magnetic dipole plus electric and magnetic quadrupole)
transitions. In each spectrum, lines are grouped into multiplets which
are arranged in order of ascending lower- and upper-level energies,
respectively. For each line, the emission transition probability
A$_{ki}$, the line strength S, and (for allowed lines) the
absorption oscillator strength f$_{ik}$ are given, together with
the spectroscopic designation, the wavelength, the statistical weights,
and the energy levels of the lower and upper states. The estimated
relative uncertainties of the line strength are also indicated, as are
the source citations. We include only those lines whose transition rates
are deemed sufficiently accurate to qualify as reference values. Short

	Abstract = {{We derive the delay-time distribution (DTD) of Type Ia supernovae (SNe
Ia) using a sample of 132 SNe Ia, discovered by the Sloan Digital Sky
Survey II (SDSS2) among 66 000 galaxies with spectral-based star
formation histories (SFHs). To recover the best-fitting DTD, the SFH of
every individual galaxy is compared, using Poisson statistics, to the
number of SNe that it hosted (zero or one), based on the method
introduced in Maoz et al. This SN sample differs from the SDSS2 SN Ia
sample analysed by Brandt et al., using a related, but different, DTD
recovery method. Furthermore, we use a simulation-based SN
detection-efficiency function, and we apply a number of important
corrections to the galaxy SFHs and SN Ia visibility times. The DTD that
we find has 4{$\sigma$} detections in all three of its time bins: prompt
({$\tau$} $\lt$ 0.42 Gyr), intermediate (0.42 $\lt$ {$\tau$} $\lt$ 2.4 Gyr) and
delayed ({$\tau$} $\gt$ 2.4 Gyr), indicating a continuous DTD, and it is
among the most accurate and precise among recent DTD reconstructions.
The best-fitting power-law form to the recovered DTD is t$^{-1.07
$\pm$ 0.07}$, consistent with generic {\tilde}t$^{-1}$
predictions of SN Ia progenitor models based on the
gravitational-wave-induced mergers of binary white dwarfs. The
time-integrated number of SNe Ia per formed stellar mass is
N$_{SN}$/M = 0.00130 {\plusmn} 0.00015 
M$_{&sun;}$$^{-1}$, or about 4 per cent of the stars formed
with initial masses in the 3 - 8 M$_{&sun;}$ range. This is lower
than, but largely consistent with, several recent DTD estimates based on
SN rates in galaxy clusters and in local-volume galaxies, and is higher
than, but consistent with N$_{SN}$/M estimated by comparing
volumetric SN Ia rates to cosmic SFH.

	Abstract = {{We show that the bulge and the disk of the Milky Way (MW) at
R$\lesssim$7\~{}kpc are well described by a unique chemical evolution and a
two-phase star-formation history (SFH). We argue that the populations
within this inner disk, not the entire disk, are the same, and that the
outer Lindblad resonance (OLR) of the bar plays a key role in explaining
this uniformity. In our model of a two-phase star formation history, the
metallicity, [$\alpha$/Fe] and [$\alpha$/H] distributions, and
age-metallicity relation are all compatible with the observations of
both the inner disk and bulge. The dip at [Fe/H]$\sim$0 dex seen in the
metallicity distributions of the bulge and inner disk reflects the
quenching episode in the SFH of the inner MW at age $\sim$8 Gyr, and the
common evolution of the bulge and inner disk stars. We show that at
z$\le$1.5, when the MW was starting to quench, transitioning between the
end of the $\alpha$-enhanced thick disk formation to the start of the
thin disk, and yet was still gas rich, the gas accretion rate could not
have been significant. The [$\alpha$/Fe] abundance ratio before and
after this quenching phase would be different, which is not observed.
The present analysis suggests that Milky Way history, and in particular
at the transition from the thick to the thin disk -- the epoch of the
quenching -- must have been driven by a decrease of the star formation
efficiency. We argue that the decline in the intensity of gas accretion,
the formation of the bar, and the quenching of the SFR at the same epoch
may be causally connected thus explaining their temporal coincidence
(abridged).

of three independent components, each with a well-defined mean abundance

thin disk, the Galactic thick disk, and the Galactic extreme spheroid.
The relative number of stars in the solar vicinity in each of these

properties of a metal-poor sample of candidate thick-disk stars selected
from the Radial Velocity Experiment spectroscopic survey of bright stars
to differentiate among the present scenarios of the formation of the
thick disk. In this paper, we report on a sample of 214 red giant
branch, 31 red clump/horizontal branch, and 74 main-sequence/sub-giant
branch metal-poor stars, which serves to augment our previous sample of
only giant stars. We find that the thick disk [{$\alpha$}/Fe] ratios are
enhanced and have little variation ($\lt$0.1 dex), in agreement with our
previous study. The augmented sample further allows, for the first time,
investigation of the gradients in the metal-poor thick disk. For stars
with [Fe/H] $\lt$ -1.2, the thick disk shows very small gradients,
$\lt$0.03 {\plusmn} 0.02 dex kpc$^{-1}$, in {$\alpha$}-enhancement,
while we find a +0.01 {\plusmn} 0.04 dex kpc$^{-1}$ radial gradient
and a -0.09 {\plusmn} 0.05 dex kpc$^{-1}$ vertical gradient in iron
abundance. In addition, we show that the peak of the distribution of
orbital eccentricities for our sample agrees better with models in which
the stars that comprise the thick disk were formed primarily in the
Galaxy, with direct accretion of stars contributing little. Our results
thus disfavor direct accretion of stars from dwarf galaxies into the
thick disk as a major contributor to the thick-disk population, but
cannot discriminate between alternative models for the thick disk, such
as those that invoke high-redshift (gas-rich) mergers, heating of a
pre-existing thin stellar disk by a minor merger, or efficient radial
migration of stars.

	Abstract = {{Context. Mg is the {$\alpha$} element of choice for Galactic population and
chemical evolution studies because it is easily detectable in all
late-type stars. Such studies require precise elemental abundances, and
thus departures from local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) need to be
accounted for. <BR /> Aims: Our goal is to provide reliable departure
coefficients and equivalent widths in non-LTE, and for reference in LTE,
for diagnostic lines of Mg studied in late-type stars. These can be
used, for example, to correct LTE spectra and abundances. <BR />
Methods: Using the model atom built and tested in the preceding paper in
this series, we performed non-LTE radiative transfer calculations in a
grid of 3945 stellar 1D atmospheric models. We used a sub-grid of 86
models to explore the propagation of errors in the recent atomic
collision calculations to the radiative transfer results. <BR />
Results: We obtained departure coefficients for all the levels and
equivalent widths (in LTE and non-LTE) for all the radiative transitions
included in the ``final'' model atom presented in Paper I. Here we present
and describe our results and show some examples of applications of the
data. The errors that result from uncertainties in the collisional data
are investigated and tabulated. The results for equivalent widths and
departure coefficients are made freely available. <BR /> Conclusions:
Giants tend to have negative abundance corrections while dwarfs have
positive, though small, corrections. Error analysis results show that
uncertainties related to the atomic collision data are typically on the
order of 0.01 dex or less, although for few stellar models in specific
lines uncertainties can be as large as 0.03 dex. As these errors are
less than or on the same order as typical corrections, we expect that we
can use these results to extract Mg abundances from high-quality spectra
more reliably than from classical LTE analysis.

abundance for fourteen stars with [Fe/H] from 0 to -2.5, mainly to show
how NLTE affects Mn abundances in cool stars of different metallicities.
<BR />Methods: The spectrum synthesis and Mn abundances are based on
statistical equilibrium calculations using various estimates for the
influence of hydrogen collisions.  <BR />Results: The NLTE abundances of
Mn in all studied stars are systematically higher than the LTE
abundances. At low metallicities, the NLTE abundance corrections may run
up to 0.5-0.7 dex. Instead of a strong depletion of Mn relative to Fe in
metal-poor stars as found by the other authors, we only find slightly
subsolar values of [Mn/Fe] throughout the range of metallicities
analyzed here. <BR />Conclusions: The [Mn/Fe] trend in metal-poor stars
is inconsistent with the predictions of galactic chemical evolution
models, where Mn is less produced than Fe.

	Abstract = {{The analysis of stellar abundances for odd-Z Fe-peak elements requires
accurate non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (NLTE) modelling of
spectral lines fully taking into account the hyperfine structure (HFS)
splitting of lines. Here, we investigate the statistical equilibrium of
Co in the atmospheres of cool stars and the influence of NLTE and HFS on
the formation of Co lines and abundances. Significant departures from
LTE level populations are found for CoI number densities of excited
states in CoII also differ from LTE at low metallicity. The NLTE level
populations are used to determine the abundance of Co in solar
photosphere, log{$\epsilon$} = 4.95 +/- 0.04dex, which is in agreement with
that in CI meteorites within the combined uncertainties. The spectral
lines of CoI were calculated using the results of recent measurements of
hyperfine interaction constants by UV Fourier transform spectrometry.
For CoII, the first laboratory measurements of HFS A and B factors were
performed. These highly accurate A factor measurements (errors of the
order of 3-7 per cent) allow, for the first time, reliable modelling of
CoII lines in the solar and stellar spectra and, thus, a test of the
CoI/CoII ionization equilibrium in stellar atmospheres. A differential
abundance analysis of Co is carried out for 18 stars in the metallicity
range -3.12 $\lt$ [Fe/H] $\lt$ 0. The abundances are derived by the method
of spectrum synthesis. At low [Fe/H], NLTE abundance corrections for CoI
lines are as large as +0.6,..., + 0.8dex. Thus, LTE abundances of Co in
metal-poor stars are severely underestimated. The stellar NLTE
abundances determined from the single UV line of CoII are lower by
\~{}0.5-0.6dex. The discrepancy might be attributed to possible blends that
have not been accounted for in the solar CoII line and its erroneous
oscillator strength. The increasing [Co/Fe] trend in metal-poor stars,
as calculated from the CoI lines under NLTE, can be explained if Co is
overproduced relative to Fe in massive stars. The models of Galactic
chemical evolution are wholly inadequate to describe this trend
suggesting that the problem is in supernova yields.

	Abstract = {{In this paper we investigate statistical equilibrium of Ti in the
atmospheres of late-type stars. The Ti I/Ti II level populations are
computed with available experimental atomic data, except for
photoionization and collision-induced transition rates, for which we
have to rely on theoretical approximations. For the Sun, the non-local
thermodynamic equilibrium (NLTE) line formation with adjusted H I
inelastic collision rates and MAFAGS-OS model atmosphere solve the
long-standing discrepancy between Ti I and Ti II lines. The NLTE
abundances determined from both ionization stages agree within 0.01 dex
with each other and with the Ti abundance in C I meteorites. The Ti NLTE
model does not perform similarly well for the metal-poor stars,
overestimating NLTE effects in the atmospheres of dwarfs, but
underestimating overionization for giants. Investigating different
sources of errors, we find that only [Ti/Fe] ratios based on Ti II and
Fe II lines can be safely used in studies of Galactic chemical
evolution. To avoid spurious abundance trends with metallicity and
dwarf/giant discrepancies, it is strongly recommended to disregard Ti I
lines in abundance analyses, as well as in determination of surface

by combining all available observational and theoretical information for
a star. The algorithm relies on the method of Bayesian inference, which
for the first time directly integrates the spectroscopic analysis
pipeline based on the global spectrum synthesis and allows for
comprehensive and objective error calculations given the priors.
Arbitrary input data sets can be included into our analysis and other
stellar quantities, in addition to stellar age, effective temperature,
surface gravity, and metallicity, can be computed on demand. We lay out
the mathematical framework of the method and apply it to several
observational data sets, including high- and low-resolution spectra
(UVES, NARVAL, HARPS, SDSS/SEGUE). We find that simpler approximations
for the spectroscopic probability distribution function, which are
inherent to past Bayesian approaches, lead to deviations of several
standard deviations and unreliable errors on the same data. By its
flexibility and the simultaneous analysis of multiple independent
measurements for a star, it will be ideal to analyse and cross-calibrate
the large ongoing and forthcoming surveys, like Gaia-European Southern
Observatory (ESO), SDSS, Gaia and LSST.

Galactic B and late-O stars. We use a new technique which employs
stellar atmosphere models in lieu of unreddened ``standard'' stars. This
technique is capable of virtually eliminating spectral mismatch errors
in the curves. It also allows a quantitative assessment of the errors
and enables a rigorous testing of the significance of relationships
between various curve parameters, regardless of whether their
uncertainties are correlated. Analysis of the curves gives the following
results: (1) In accord with our previous findings, the central position
of the 2175 A extinction bump is mildly variable, its width is highly
variable, and the two variations are unrelated. (2) Strong correlations
are found among some extinction properties within the UV region, and
within the IR region. (3) With the exception of a few curves with
extreme (i.e., large) values of R(V), the UV and IR portions of Galactic
extinction curves are not correlated with each other. (4) The large
sightline-to-sightline variation seen in our sample implies that any
average Galactic extinction curve will always reflect the biases of its
parent sample. (5) The use of an average curve to deredden a spectral
energy distribution (SED) will result in significant errors, and a
realistic error budget for the dereddened SED must include the observed
variance of Galactic curves. While the observed large
sightline-to-sightline variations, and the lack of correlation among the
various features of the curves, make it difficult to meaningfully
characterize average extinction properties, they demonstrate that
extinction curves respond sensitively to local conditions. Thus, each
curve contains potentially unique information about the grains along its
sightline.

	Abstract = {{Investigations of the origin and evolution of the Milky Way disc have
long relied on chemical and kinematic identifications of its components
to reconstruct our Galactic past. Difficulties in determining precise
stellar ages have restricted most studies to small samples, normally
confined to the solar neighbourhood. Here, we break this impasse with
the help of asteroseismic inference and perform a chronology of the
evolution of the disc throughout the age of the Galaxy. We chemically
dissect the Milky Way disc population using a sample of red giant stars
spanning out to 2 kpc in the solar annulus observed by the Kepler
satellite, with the added dimension of asteroseismic ages. Our results
reveal a clear difference in age between the low- and high-{$\alpha$}
populations, which also show distinct velocity dispersions in the V and
W components. We find no tight correlation between age and metallicity
nor [{$\alpha$}/Fe] for the high-{$\alpha$} disc stars. Our results indicate
that this component formed over a period of more than 2 Gyr with a wide
range of [M/H] and [{$\alpha$}/Fe] independent of time. Our findings show
that the kinematic properties of young {$\alpha$}-rich stars are consistent
with the rest of the high-{$\alpha$} population and different from the
low-{$\alpha$} stars of similar age, rendering support to their origin
being old stars that went through a mass transfer or stellar merger
event, making them appear younger, instead of migration of truly young
stars formed close to the Galactic bar.

	Abstract = {{The discovery of lithium-rich giants contradicts expectations from
canonical stellar evolution. Here we report on the serendipitous
discovery of 20 Li-rich giants observed during the Gaia-ESO Survey,
which includes the first nine Li-rich giant stars known towards the
CoRoT fields. Most of our Li-rich giants have near-solar metallicities
and stellar parameters consistent with being before the luminosity bump.
This is difficult to reconcile with deep mixing models proposed to
explain lithium enrichment, because these models can only operate at
later evolutionary stages: at or past the luminosity bump. In an effort
to shed light on the Li-rich phenomenon, we highlight recent evidence of
the tidal destruction of close-in hot Jupiters at the sub-giant phase.
We note that when coupled with models of planet accretion, the observed
destruction of hot Jupiters actually predicts the existence of Li-rich
giant stars, and suggests that Li-rich stars should be found early on
the giant branch and occur more frequently with increasing metallicity.
A comprehensive review of all known Li-rich giant stars reveals that
this scenario is consistent with the data. However, more evolved or
metal-poor stars are less likely to host close-in giant planets,
implying that their Li-rich origin requires an alternative explanation,
likely related to mixing scenarios rather than external phenomena.

	Abstract = {{A large, perhaps dominant fraction, of the Milky Way's halo is thought
to be built up by the accretion of smaller galaxies and their globular
cluster (GC) systems. Here, we examine the Milky Way's GC system to
estimate the fraction of accreted versus in situ formed GCs. We first
assemble a high-quality data base of ages and metallicities for 93 Milky
Way GCs from literature deep colour-magnitude data. The age-metallicity
relation for Milky Way's GCs reveals two distinct tracks - one with near
constant old age of \~{}12.8 Gyr and the other branches to younger ages. We
find that the latter young track is dominated by GCs associated with the
Sagittarius and Canis Major dwarf galaxies. Despite being overly
simplistic, its age-metallicity relation can be well represented by a
simple closed box model with continuous star formation. The inferred
chemical enrichment history is similar to that of the Large Magellanic
Cloud, but is more enriched, at a given age, compared to the Small
Magellanic Cloud.

After excluding Sagittarius and Canis Major GCs, several young track GCs
remain. Their horizontal branch morphologies are often red and hence
classified as young halo objects; however, they do not tend to reveal
extended horizontal branches (a possible signature of an accreted
remnant nucleus). Retrograde orbit GCs (a key signature of accretion)
are commonly found in the young track. We also examine GCs that lie
close to the Fornax-Leo-Sculptor great circle defined by several
satellite galaxies. We find that several GCs are consistent with the
young track and we speculate that they may have been accreted along with
their host dwarf galaxy, whose nucleus may survive as a GC. Finally, we
suggest that 27-47 GCs (about 1/4 of the entire system), from six to
eight dwarf galaxies, were accreted to build the Milky Way GC system we
see today.

	Abstract = {{We present elemental abundances for 855 red giant branch (RGB) stars in
the globular cluster Omega Centauri ({$\omega$} Cen) from spectra obtained
with the Blanco 4 m telescope and Hydra multifiber spectrograph. The
sample includes nearly all RGB stars brighter than V = 13.5 and spans
{$\omega$} Cen's full metallicity range. The heavy {$\alpha$} elements (Si,
Ca, and Ti) are generally enhanced by \~{}+0.3 dex and exhibit a
metallicity-dependent morphology that may be attributed to mass and
metallicity-dependent Type II supernova (SN) yields. The heavy {$\alpha$}
and Fe-peak abundances suggest minimal contributions from Type Ia SNe.
The light elements (O, Na, and Al) exhibit $\gt$0.5 dex abundance
dispersions at all metallicities, and a majority of stars with
[Fe/H]$\gt$ - 1.6 have [O/Fe], [Na/Fe], and [Al/Fe] abundances similar to
those in monometallic globular clusters, as well as O-Na, O-Al
anticorrelations and the Na-Al correlation in all but the most
metal-rich stars. A combination of pollution from intermediate-mass
asymptotic giant branch stars and in situ mixing may explain the light
element abundance patterns. A large fraction (27\%) of {$\omega$} Cen stars
are O-poor ([O/Fe] $\lt$ 0) and are preferentially located within 5'-10'
of the cluster center. The O-poor giants are spatially similar, located
in the same metallicity range, and are present in nearly equal
proportions to blue main-sequence stars. This suggests that the O-poor
giants and blue main-sequence stars may share a common origin. [La/Fe]
increases sharply at [Fe/H] $\gt$\~{} -1.6, and the [La/Eu] ratios indicate
that the increase is due to almost pure s-process production.

observations from 2011 and 2012 of the globular cluster M 30 (NGC 7099).
We used our data to search for variable stars in this cluster and refine
the periods of known variables; we then used our variable star light
curves to derive values for the cluster's parameters. <BR /> Methods: We
used difference image analysis to reduce our data to obtain
high-precision light curves of variable stars. We then estimated the
cluster parameters by performing a Fourier decomposition of the light
curves of RR Lyrae stars for which a good period estimate was possible.
We also derived an estimate for the age of the cluster by fitting
theoretical isochrones to our colour-magnitude diagram (CMD). <BR />
Results: Out of 13 stars previously catalogued as variables, we find
that only 4 are bona fide variables. We detect two new RR Lyrae
variables, and confirm two additional RR Lyrae candidates from the
literature. We also detect four other new variables, including an
eclipsing blue straggler system, and an SX Phoenicis star. This amounts
to a total number of confirmed variable stars in M 30 of 12. We perform
Fourier decomposition of the light curves of the RR Lyrae stars to
derive cluster parameters using empirical relations. We find a cluster
metallicity [Fe/H]$_{ZW}$ = -2.01 {\plusmn} 0.04, or
[Fe/H]$_{UVES}$ = -2.11 {\plusmn} 0.06, and a distance of 8.32
{\plusmn} 0.20 kpc (using RR0 variables), 8.10 kpc (using one RR1
variable), and 8.35 {\plusmn} 0.42 kpc (using our SX Phoenicis star
detection in M 30). Fitting isochrones to the CMD, we estimate an age of
13.0 {\plusmn} 1.0 Gyr for M 30.

	Abstract = {{To check the impact of the multiple population scenario for globular
clusters on their horizontal branch (HB), we present an analysis of the
composition of 110 red HB (RHB) stars in 47 Tucanae and of 61 blue HB
(BHB) and 30 RHB stars in M 5. In 47 Tuc we found tight relations
between the colours of the stars and their abundances of p-capture
elements. This strongly supports the idea that the He content - which is
expected to be closely correlated with the abundances of p-capture
elements - is the third parameter (after overall metallicity and age)
that determines the colour of HB stars. However, the range in He
abundance must be small ({$\Delta$}Y $\lt$ 0.03) in 47 Tuc to reproduce our
observations; this agrees with previous analyses. There is possibly a
correlation between the abundances of p- and n-capture elements in 47
Tuc. If confirmed, this might suggest that asymptotic giant branch stars
of moderate mass contributed to the gas from which second-generation
stars formed. Considering the selection effects in our sample (which
does not include stars warmer than 11 000 K and RR Lyrae variables,
which were excluded because we could not obtain accurate abundances with
the adopted observing procedure) is important to understand our results
for M 5. In this case, we find that, as expected, RHB stars are Na-poor
and O-rich, and likely belong to the primordial population. There is a
clear correlation of the [Na/O] ratio and N abundance with colour along
the BHB. A derivation of the He abundance for these stars yields a low
value of Y = 0.22 {\plusmn} 0.03. This is expected because HB stars of a
putative He-rich population in this cluster should be warmer than 11 000
K, and would accordingly not have been sampled by our analysis. However,
we need some additional source of scatter in the total mass loss of
stars climbing up the red giant branch to reproduce our results for M 5.
Finally, we found a C-star on the HB of 47 Tuc and a Ba-rich,
fast-rotating, likely binary star on the HB of M 5. These stars are
among the brightest and coolest HB stars.

	Abstract = {{Precise studies on the Galactic bulge, globular cluster, Galactic halo,
and Galactic thick disc require stellar models with {$\alpha$} enhancement
and various values of helium content. These models are also important
for extra-Galactic population synthesis studies. For this purpose, we
complement the existing PARSEC models, which are based on the solar
partition of heavy elements, with {$\alpha$}-enhanced partitions. We
collect detailed measurements on the metal mixture and helium abundance
for the two populations of 47 Tuc (NGC 104) from the literature, and
calculate stellar tracks and isochrones with these {$\alpha$}-enhanced
compositions. By fitting the precise colour-magnitude diagram with HST
ACS/WFC data, from low main sequence till horizontal branch (HB), we
calibrate some free parameters that are important for the evolution of
low mass stars like the mixing at the bottom of the convective envelope.
This new calibration significantly improves the prediction of the red
giant branch bump (RGBB) brightness. Comparison with the observed RGB
and HB luminosity functions also shows that the evolutionary lifetimes
are correctly predicted. As a further result of this calibration
process, we derive the age, distance modulus, reddening, and the RGB
mass-loss for 47 Tuc. We apply the new calibration and {$\alpha$}-enhanced
mixtures of the two 47 Tuc populations ([{$\alpha$}/Fe] {\tilde} 0.4 and
0.2) to other metallicities. The new models reproduce the RGB bump
observations much better than previous models. This new PARSEC data
base, with the newly updated {$\alpha$}-enhanced stellar evolutionary
tracks and isochrones, will also be a part of the new stellar products
for Gaia.

	Abstract = {{The existence of a vertical age gradient in the Milky Way disc has been
indirectly known for long. Here, we measure it directly for the first
time with seismic ages, using red giants observed by Kepler. We use
Str{\"o}mgren photometry to gauge the selection function of
asteroseismic targets, and derive colour and magnitude limits where
giants with measured oscillations are representative of the underlying
population in the field. Limits in the 2MASS system are also derived. We
lay out a method to assess and correct for target selection effects
independent of Galaxy models. We find that low-mass, I.e. old red giants
dominate at increasing Galactic heights, whereas closer to the Galactic
plane they exhibit a wide range of ages and metallicities. Parametrizing
this as a vertical gradient returns approximately 4 Gyr kpc$^{-1}$
for the disc we probe, although with a large dispersion of ages at all
heights. The ages of stars show a smooth distribution over the last
{\sime}10 Gyr, consistent with a mostly quiescent evolution for the Milky
Way disc since a redshift of about 2. We also find a flat
age-metallicity relation for disc stars. Finally, we show how to use
secondary clump stars to estimate the present-day intrinsic metallicity
spread, and suggest using their number count as a new proxy for tracing
the ageing of the disc. This work highlights the power of
asteroseismology for Galactic studies; however, we also emphasize the
need for better constraints on stellar mass-loss, which is a major
source of systematic age uncertainties in red giant stars.

	Abstract = {{Setting the timeline of the events which shaped the Milky Way disc
through its 13 billion year old history is one of the major challenges
in the theory of galaxy formation. Achieving this goal is possible using
late-type stars, which in virtue of their long lifetimes can be regarded
as fossil remnants from various epochs of the formation of the Galaxy.
There are two main paths to reliably age-date late-type stars:
astrometric distances for stars in the turn-off and subgiant region, or
oscillation frequencies along the red giant branch. So far, these
methods have been applied to large samples of stars in the solar
neighbourhood, and in the Kepler field. I review these studies,
emphasize how they complement each other, and highlight some of the
constraints they provide for Galactic modelling. I conclude with the
prospects and synergies that astrometric ($\{$Gaia$\}$) and asteroseismic
space-borne missions reserve to the field of Galactic archaeology, and
advocate that survey selection functions should be kept as simple as
possible, relying on basic observables such as colours and magnitudes
only.

	Abstract = {{The measurement of the structure of stellar populations in the Milky Way
disc places fundamental constraints on models of galaxy formation and
evolution. Previously, the disc's structure has been studied in terms of
populations defined geometrically and/or chemically, but a decomposition
based on stellar ages provides a more direct connection to the history
of the disc, and stronger constraint on theory. Here, we use positions,
abundances and ages for 31 244 red giant branch stars from the Sloan
Digital Sky Survey (SDSS)-APOGEE survey, spanning 3 $\lt$ R$_{gc}$
$\lt$ 15 kpc, to dissect the disc into mono-age and mono-[Fe/H]
populations at low and high [{$\alpha$}/Fe]. For each population, with
{$\Delta$}age $\lt$ 2 Gyr and {$\Delta$}[Fe/H] $\lt$ 0.1 dex, we measure the
structure and surface-mass density contribution. We find that low
[{$\alpha$}/Fe] mono-age populations are fit well by a broken exponential,
which increases to a peak radius and decreases thereafter. We show that
this profile becomes broader with age, interpreted here as a new signal
of disc heating and radial migration. High [{$\alpha$}/Fe] populations are
well fit as single exponentials within the radial range considered, with
an average scalelength of 1.9 {\plusmn} 0.1 kpc. We find that the
relative contribution of high to low [{$\alpha$}/Fe] populations at
R$_{0}$ is f\_{$\Sigma$} = 18 per cent {\plusmn} 5 per cent; high
[{$\alpha$}/Fe] contributes most of the mass at old ages, and low
[{$\alpha$}/Fe] at young ages. The low and high [{$\alpha$}/Fe] populations
overlap in age at intermediate [Fe/H], although both contribute mass at
R$_{0}$ across the full range of [Fe/H]. The mass-weighted
scaleheight h$_{Z}$ distribution is a smoothly declining
exponential function. High [{$\alpha$}/Fe] populations are thicker than low
[{$\alpha$}/Fe], and the average h$_{Z}$ increases steadily with age,
between 200 and 600 pc.

	Abstract = {{We study seven simulated disc galaxies, three with a quiescent merger
history, and four with mergers in their last 9 Gyr of evolution. We
compare their structure at z = 0 by decomposing them into `mono-age
populations' (MAPs) of stars within 500 Myr age bins. All studied
galaxies undergo a phase of merging activity at high redshift, so that
stars older than 9 Gyr are found in a centrally concentrated component,
while younger stars are mostly found in discs. We find that most MAPs
have simple exponential radial and vertical density profiles, with a
scaleheight that typically increases with age. Because a large range of
merger histories can create populations with simple structures, this
suggests that the simplicity of the structure of mono-abundance
populations observed in the Milky Way by Bovy et al. is not necessarily
a direct indicator of a quiescent history for the Milky Way. Similarly,
the anticorrelation between scalelength and scaleheight does not
necessarily imply a merger-free history. However, mergers produce
discontinuities between thin and thick disc components, and jumps in the
age-velocity relation. The absence of a structural discontinuity between
thin and thick disc observed in the Milky Way would seem to be a good
indicator that no merger with a mass ratio larger than 1:15-1:10
occurred in the last 9 Gyr. Mergers at higher redshift might
nevertheless be necessary to produce the thickest, hottest components of
the Milky Way's disc.

	Abstract = {{We analyze the present day structure and assembly history of a
high-resolution hydrodynamic simulation of the formation of a
Milky-Way-(MW)-like disk galaxy, from the ``Eris'' simulation suite,
dissecting it into cohorts of stars formed at different epochs of cosmic
history. At z = 0, stars with t $_{form}$ $\lt$ 2 Gyr mainly occupy
the stellar spheroid, with the oldest (earliest forming) stars having
more centrally concentrated profiles. The younger age cohorts populate
disks of progressively longer radial scale lengths and shorter vertical
scale heights. At a given radius, the vertical density profiles and
velocity dispersions of stars vary smoothly as a function of age, and
the superposition of old, vertically extended and young, vertically
compact cohorts gives rise to a double-exponential profile like that
observed in the MW. Turning to formation history, we find that the
trends of spatial structure and kinematics with stellar age are largely
imprinted at birth, or immediately thereafter. Stars that form during
the active merger phase at z $\gt$ 3 are quickly scattered into rounded,
kinematically hot configurations. The oldest disk cohorts form in
structures that are radially compact and relatively thick, while
subsequent cohorts form in progressively larger, thinner, colder
configurations from gas with increasing levels of rotational support.
The disk thus forms ``inside out'' in a radial sense and ``upside down'' in
a vertical sense. Secular heating and radial migration influence the
final state of each age cohort, but the changes they produce are small
compared to the trends established at formation. The predicted
correlations of stellar age with spatial and kinematic structure are in
good qualitative agreement with the correlations observed for
mono-abundance stellar populations in the MW.

most recent ideas on stellar nucleosynthesis and supernova (SN)

accretion of primordial material coming from outside with a time-scale
which is a function of the galactocentric distance. The possibility of
forming the disk out of enriched halo gas is also studied in a simple
way. The evolution of the abundances of several single elements is
predicted as well as that of gas mass, SN rates and star formation rate,
both in the solar neighborhood and in the whole disk, under different
assumptions for the star formation rate. Abundance gradients along the
galactic disk are well reproduced and a possible interpretation for the
differences among gradients of different elements is given in terms of
nucleosynthesis and stellar lifetimes. This interpretation can represent
a key for understanding gradients also in external galaxies. In
particular, a natural explanation is suggested for the positive gradient

clusters are ideal laboratories for such an abundance analysis as the
relative stellar parameters of their stars can be precisely determined.
<BR /> Methods: We performed a homogeneous chemical abundance analysis
of 144 stars in the metal-poor globular cluster M30, ranging from the
cluster turnoff point to the tip of the red giant branch. Non-local
thermal equilibrium (NLTE) abundances for Li, Ca, and Fe were derived
where possible by fitting spectra obtained with VLT/FLAMES-GIRAFFE using
the quantitative-spectroscopy package SME. Stellar parameters were
derived by matching isochrones to the observed V vs. V-I
colour-magnitude diagram. Independent effective temperatures were
obtained from automated profile fitting of the Balmer lines and by
applying colour-T$_{eff}$ calibrations to the broadband
photometry. <BR /> Results: Li abundances of the turnoff and early
subgiant stars form a thin plateau that is broken off abruptly in the
middle of the SGB as a result of the onset of Li dilution caused by the
first dredge-up. Abundance trends with effective temperature for Fe and
Ca are observed and compared to predictions from stellar structure
models including atomic diffusion and ad hoc additional mixing below the
surface convection zone. The comparison shows that the stars in M30 are
affected by atomic diffusion and additional mixing, but we were unable
to determine the efficiency of the additional mixing precisely. This is
the fourth globular cluster (after NGC 6397, NGC 6752, and M4) in which
atomic diffusion signatures are detected. After applying a conservative
correction (T6.0 model) for atomic diffusion, we find an initial Li
abundance of A(Li) = 2.48 {\plusmn} 0.10 for the globular cluster M30. We
also detected a Li-rich SGB star with a Li abundance of A(Li) = 2.39.
The finding makes Li-rich mass transfer a likely scenario for this star
and rules out models in which its Li enhancement is created during the
RGB bump phase.

	Abstract = {{Photospheric abundances are presented for 27 elements from carbon to
europium in 181 F and G dwarfs from a differential local thermodynamic
equilibrium (LTE) analysis of high-resolution and high signal-to-noise
ratio spectra. Stellar effective temperatures (T$_{eff}$) were
adopted from an infrared flux method calibration of Str{\"o}mgren
photometry. Stellar surface gravities (g) were calculated from Hipparcos
parallaxes and stellar evolutionary tracks. Adopted T$_{eff}$ and
g values are in good agreement with spectroscopic estimates. Stellar
ages were determined from evolutionary tracks. Stellar space motions (U,
V, W) and a Galactic potential were used to estimate Galactic orbital
parameters. These show that the vast majority of the stars belong to the
Galactic thin disc.

Relative abundances expressed as [X/Fe] generally confirm previously
published results. We give results for C, N, O, Na, Mg, Al, Si, S, K,
Ca, Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Sr, Y, Zr, Ba, Ce, Nd and Eu. The
{$\alpha$} elements - O, Mg, Si, Ca and Ti - show [{$\alpha$}/Fe] to increase
slightly with decreasing [Fe/H]. Heavy elements with dominant
contributions at solar metallicity from the s-process show [s/Fe] to
decrease slightly with decreasing [Fe/H]. Scatter in [X/Fe] at a fixed
[Fe/H] is entirely attributable to the small measurement errors, after
excluding the few thick disc stars and the s-process-enriched CH
subgiants. Tight limits are set on `cosmic' scatter. If a weak trend
with [Fe/H] is taken into account, the composition of a thin disc star
expressed as [X/Fe] is independent of the star's age and birthplace for
elements contributed in different proportions by massive stars (Type II
supernovae), exploding white dwarfs (Type Ia supernovae) and asymptotic
red giant branch stars.

By combining our sample with various published studies, comparisons
between thin and thick disc stars are made. In this composite sample,
thick disc stars are primarily identified by their V$_{LSR}$ in
the range -40 to -100 km s$^{-1}$. These are very old stars with
origins in the inner Galaxy and metallicities [Fe/H]$\lt$=-0.4. At the
same [Fe/H], the sampled thin disc stars have V$_{LSR}$\~{} 0 km
s$^{-1}$, and are generally younger with a birthplace at about the
Sun's Galactocentric distance. In the range -0.35 $\gt$=[Fe/H]$\gt$=-0.70,
well represented by present thin and thick disc samples, [X/Fe] of the
thick disc stars is greater than that of thin disc stars for Mg, Al, Si,
Ca, Ti and Eu. [X/Fe] is very similar for the thin and thick disc for -
notably - Na and iron-group elements. Barium ([Ba/Fe]) may be
underabundant in thick relative to thin disc stars. These results extend
previous ideas about composition differences between the thin and thick
disc.

	Abstract = {{A method is proposed to separate density functions along the line of
sight for both disk- and halo-population stars with three-color
photometry. The observed star counts as a function of visual magnitude
and color are synthesized by an integral equation, where the luminosity
function is assumed to be that of van Rhijn for the disk stars and that
of globular clusters M92 and M3 for the field halo stars, respectively.
Adopting the conventional exponential density law for both disk and halo
stars, we derive the density gradient d log D(z)/dz (z in kpc) toward
the north galactic pole. The density gradient is almost uniquely
determined to be -1.4 for the disk stars and -0.2 for the halo stars
with the halo density outnumbering the disk beyond z{\ge}2 kpc. The halo
mass density is estimated to be (3-5) {\times} 1O$^{-4}$

measurements for 314 transitions between 2276 {\AA} and 9357 {\AA}.
Ninety-five of these transitions were subjected to the procedure
developed by Cardon, Smith, and Whaling which fits combined absorption
and emission data to a set of consistent, optimum, relative oscillator
strengths and upper level lifetimes. These relative values were
normalized to the radiative lifetimes of Figger et al. and of Marek and
Vogt obtained by pulsed laser fluorescence. Absolute oscillator
strengths for 362 transitions and 36 lifetimes were determined. Typical
uncertainties in the reported absolute oscillator strengths are
{\plusmn}15-25\% (2/3 confidence level).

Equivalent widths were obtained for nineteen solar cobalt lines with the
McMath solar telescope at Kitt Peak National Observatory. These widths
were used to redetermine the solar cobalt abundance, assuming the
photospheric model of Holweger and a microturbulence velocity of 1.0 km
s$^{-1}$. The adopted solar cobalt abundance is the mean value log
Co/N$_{H}$$\gt$ + 12 = 4.92 {\plusmn} 0.08 ({\plusmn}19\%), from the
19 cobalt transitions. This value is in excellent agreement with the

recent solar data and multi-component Hartree-Fock calculations of
oscillator strengths. The equivalent widths of six solar neutral zinc
transitions at wavelengths from 4680 to 13053 A considered by Lambert et
al. (1969) are analyzed in terms of the neutral zinc oscillator
strengths calculated by Biemont and Godefroid (1979), with the effects
of microturbulence taken into account. Abundances of 4.59 plus or minus
0.01 and 4.60 plus or minus 0.03 are obtained using the revised Holweger
model (1974) and the atmospheric model of Vernazza (1976), respectively,
with a microturbulence parameter of 0.8. It is pointed out that these
abundances are now in good agreement with meteoritic zinc abundances.

test of their oscillator strengths. Although this is not regarded as a
definitive solar analysis, because of the weakness of the solar lines,
the value of log A = 5.08, with a microturbulence value of 0.89 km/sec,
both agree well with those already found for stronger 0-eV lines.

spectra recorded using a 3 m echelle spectrometer are combined with

The new Ti I data are applied to re-determine the Ti abundance in the

error in the mean iron abundance from Fe II lines is negligible

	Abstract = {{The Gaia-ESO survey (GES) is now in its fifth and last year of
observations and has produced tens of thousands of high-quality spectra
of stars in all Milky Way components. This paper presents the strategy
behind the selection of astrophysical calibration targets, ensuring that
all GES results on radial velocities, atmospheric parameters, and
chemical abundance ratios will be both internally consistent and easily
comparable with other literature results, especially from other large
spectroscopic surveys and from Gaia. The calibration of GES is
particularly delicate because of (I) the large space of parameters
covered by its targets, ranging from dwarfs to giants, from O to M
stars; these targets have a large wide of metallicities and also include
fast rotators, emission line objects, and stars affected by veiling;
(II) the variety of observing setups, with different wavelength ranges
and resolution; and (III) the choice of analyzing the data with many
different state-of-the-art methods, each stronger in a different region
of the parameter space, which ensures a better understanding of
systematic uncertainties. An overview of the GES calibration and
homogenization strategy is also given, along with some examples of the
usage and results of calibrators in GES iDR4, which is the fourth
internal GES data release and will form the basis of the next GES public
data release. The agreement between GES iDR4 recommended values and
reference values for the calibrating objects are very satisfactory. The
average offsets and spreads are generally compatible with the GES
measurement errors, which in iDR4 data already meet the requirements set
by the main GES scientific goals.

	Abstract = {{We explore to what extent stars within Galactic disk open clusters
resemble each other in the high-dimensional space of their photospheric
element abundances and contrast this with pairs of field stars. Our
analysis is based on abundances for 20 elements, homogeneously derived
from APOGEE spectra (with carefully quantified uncertainties of
typically 0.03 dex). We consider 90 red giant stars in seven open
clusters and find that most stars within a cluster have abundances in
most elements that are indistinguishable (in a $\{${$\chi$}
$\}$$^{2}$-sense) from those of the other members, as expected for
stellar birth siblings. An analogous analysis among pairs of $\gt$ 1000
field stars shows that highly significant abundance differences in the
20 dimensional space can be established for the vast majority of these
pairs, and that the APOGEE-based abundance measurements have high
discriminating power. However, pairs of field stars whose abundances are
indistinguishable even at 0.03 dex precision exist: {\sim}0.3\% of all
field star pairs and {\sim}1.0\% of field star pairs at the same (solar)
metallicity [Fe/H] = 0 {\plusmn} 0.02. Most of these pairs are presumably
not birth siblings from the same cluster, but rather doppelg{\"a}ngers.
Our analysis implies that {\ldquo}chemical tagging{\rdquo} in the strict
sense, identifying birth siblings for typical disk stars through their
abundance similarity alone, will not work with such data. However, our
approach shows that abundances have extremely valuable information for
probabilistic chemo-orbital modeling, and combined with velocities, we
have identified new cluster members from the field.

	Abstract = {{Atmospheric parameters and chemical compositions for 10 stars with
metallicities in the region of -2.2 $\lt$ [Fe/H] $\lt$ -0.6 were precisely
determined using high-resolution, high signal-to-noise, spectra. For
each star, the abundances, for 14-27 elements, were derived using both
local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) and non-LTE (NLTE) approaches. In
particular, differences by assuming LTE or NLTE are about 0.10 dex;
depending on [Fe/H], T$_{eff}$, gravity and element lines used in
the analysis. We find that the O abundance has the largest error,
ranging from 0.10 and 0.2 dex. The best measured elements are Cr, Fe,
and Mn; with errors between 0.03 and 0.11 dex. The stars in our sample
were included in previous different observational work. We provide a
consistent data analysis. The data dispersion introduced in the
literature by different techniques and assumptions used by the different
authors is within the observational errors, excepting for HD103095. We
compare these results with stellar observations from different data sets
and a number of theoretical galactic chemical evolution (GCE)
simulations. We find a large scatter in the GCE results, used to study
the origin of the elements. Within this scatter as found in previous GCE
simulations, we cannot reproduce the evolution of the elemental ratios
[Sc/Fe], [Ti/Fe], and [V/Fe] at different metallicities. The stellar
yields from core-collapse supernovae are likely primarily responsible
for this discrepancy. Possible solutions and open problems are
discussed.

	Abstract = {{Core helium burning primary red clump (RC) stars are evolved red giant
stars that are excellent standard candles. As such, these stars are
routinely used to map the Milky Way or determine the distance to other
galaxies, among other things. However, distinguishing RC stars from
their less evolved precursors, namely red giant branch (RGB) stars, is
still a difficult challenge and has been deemed the domain of
asteroseismology. In this paper, we use a sample of 1676 RGB and RC
stars that have both single epoch infrared spectra from the APOGEE
survey and asteroseismic parameters and classification to show that the
spectra alone can be used to (1) predict asteroseismic parameters with
precision high enough to (2) distinguish core helium burning RC from
other giant stars with less than 2\% contamination. This will not only
allow for a clean selection of a large number of standard candles across
our own and other galaxies from spectroscopic surveys, but also will
remove one of the primary roadblocks for stellar evolution studies of
mixing and mass loss in red giant stars.

	Abstract = {{The observable spectrum of an unresolved binary star system is a
superposition of two single-star spectra. Even without a detectable
velocity offset between the two stellar components, the combined
spectrum of a binary system is in general different from that of either
component, and fitting it with single-star models may yield inaccurate
stellar parameters and abundances. We perform simple experiments with
synthetic spectra to investigate the effect of unresolved main-sequence
binaries on spectral fitting, modelling spectra similar to those
collected by the APOGEE, GALAH and LAMOST surveys. We find that fitting
unresolved binaries with single-star models introduces systematic biases
in the derived stellar parameters and abundances that are modest but
certainly not negligible, with typical systematic errors of 300 K in
T$_{eff}$, 0.1 dex in log g and 0.1 dex in [Fe/H] for APOGEE-like
spectra of solar-type stars. These biases are smaller for spectra at
optical wavelengths than in the near-infrared. We show that biases can
be corrected by fitting spectra with a binary model, which adds only two
labels to the fit and includes single-star models as a special case. Our
model provides a promising new method to constrain the Galactic binary
population, including systems with single-epoch spectra and no
detectable velocity offset between the two stars.

corrections in a single band, when input stellar parameters are well
known for FG dwarfs at various metallicities. This sole source of
uncertainty impacts interferometric T$_{eff}$ to {\sime} 0.5
percent (or 30 K at the solar temperature). Uncertainties are halved
when combining bolometric corrections in more bands, and limited by the
fundamental uncertainty of the current absolute flux scale at 1 percent.
Stars in the RAVE DR5 catalogue are used to validate the quality of our

@article{Ting2017,
	Abstract = {{Oxygen is the most abundant ``metal'' element in stars and in the cosmos.
But determining oxygen abundances in stars has proven challenging,
because of the shortage of detectable atomic oxygen lines in their
optical spectra as well as observational and theoretical complications
with these lines (e.g., blends, 3D, non-LTE). Nonetheless, Ting et al.
(2017) were recently able to demonstrate that oxygen abundances can be
determined from low-resolution (R$\simeq$2000) optical spectra. Here we
investigate the physical processes that enable such a measurement for
cool stars, such as K-giants. We show that the strongest spectral
diagnostics of oxygen come from the CNO atomic-molecular network, but
are manifested in spectral features that do not involve oxygen. In the
outer atmosphere layers most of the carbon is locked up in CO, and
changes to the oxygen abundance directly affect the abundances of all
other carbon-bearing molecules, thereby changing the strength of CH, CN,
and C$\_2$ features across the optical spectrum. In deeper atmosphere
layers most of the carbon is in atomic form, and any change in the
oxygen abundance has little effect on the other carbon-bearing
molecules. The key physical effect enabling such oxygen abundance
measurements is that spectral features in the optical arise from both
the CO-dominant and the atomic carbon-dominant regions, providing
non-degenerate constraints on both C and O. Beyond the case at hand, the
results show that physically sound abundances measurements need not be
limited to those elements that have observable lines themselves.

time series analysis of stellar spectral variations and radial velocity
variations from stellar companions, to spatial maps of kinematics,
metallicity, and abundance patterns across the Galaxy and as a function

for 31 even-parity levels of Fe I ranging from 45061 cm$^{-1}$ to

single-step and two-step time-resolved laser-induced fluorescence on a
slow atomic beam of iron atoms. Branching fractions have been attempted
for all of these levels, and completed for 20 levels. This set of levels
represents an extension of the collaborative work reported in Ruffoni et
al. The radiative lifetimes combined with the branching fractions yields
new oscillator strengths for 203 lines of Fe I. Utilizing a 1D-LTE model
of the solar photosphere, spectral syntheses for a subset of these lines
which are unblended in the solar spectrum yields a mean iron abundance

	Abstract = {{The chemical abundance patterns of the oldest stars in the Galaxy are
expected to contain residual signatures of the first stars in the early
universe. Numerous studies attempt to explain the intrinsic abundance
scatter observed in some metal-poor populations in terms of chemical
inhomogeneities dispersed throughout the early Galactic medium due to
discrete enrichment events. Just how the complex data and models are to
be interpreted with respect to ``progenitor yields'' remains an open
question. Here we show that stochastic chemical evolution models to date
have overlooked a crucial fact. Essentially, all stars today are born in
highly homogeneous star clusters and it is likely that this was also
true at early times. When this ingredient is included, the overall
scatter in the abundance plane [Fe/H] versus [X/Fe] ($\{$C$\}$-space), where X
is a nucleosynthetic element, can be much less than derived from earlier
models. Moreover, for moderately flat cluster mass functions ({$\gamma$}
$\lt$\~{} 2), and/or for mass functions with a high mass cutoff (M
$_{max}$ $\gt$\~{} 10$^{5}$ M $_{sun}$), stars exhibit a
high degree of clumping in $\{$C$\}$-space that can be identified even in
relatively small data samples. Since stellar abundances can be modified
by mass transfer in close binaries, clustered signatures are essential
for deriving the yields of the first supernovae. We present a
statistical test to determine whether a given set of observations
exhibit such behavior. Our initial work focuses on two dimensions in
$\{$C$\}$-space, but we show that the clustering signal can be greatly
enhanced by additional abundance axes. The proposed experiment will be
challenging on existing 8-10 m telescopes, but relatively
straightforward for a multi-object echelle spectrograph mounted on a
25-40 m telescope.

	Abstract = {{The Galactic disk retains vast amount of information about how it came
to be and how it evolved over cosmic time. However, we know very little
about the secular processes associated with disk evolution. One major
uncertainty is the extent to which stars migrate radially through the
disk, thereby washing out signatures of their past (e.g., birth sites).
Recent theoretical work finds that such ``blurring'' of the disk can be
important if spiral arms are transient phenomena. Here we describe an
experiment to determine the importance of diffusion from the Solar
circle with cosmic time. Consider a star cluster that has been placed
into a differentially rotating, stellar fluid. We show that all clusters
up to \~{}10$^{4}$ M $_{sun}$ in mass, and a significant
fraction of those up to \~{}10$^{5}$ M $_{sun}$, are expected
to be chemically homogeneous, and that clusters of this size can be
assigned a unique ``chemical tag'' by measuring the abundances of lsim10
independent element groups, with better age and orbit determinations
allowing fewer abundance measurements. The star cluster therefore acts
like a ``tracer dye,'' and the present-day distribution of its stars
provides a strong constraint on the rate of radial diffusion or
migration in the Galactic disk. A star cluster of particular interest
for this application is the ``Solar family''{\mdash}the stars that were
born with the Sun. If we were able to identify a significant fraction of
these, we could determine whether the Sun was born at its present radius
or much further in. We show all-sky projections for the Solar family
under different dynamical scenarios and identify the most advantageous
fields on the sky for the experiment. Sellwood {\amp} Binney have argued
for strong radial transport driven by transient spiral perturbations: in
principle, we could measure the strength of this migration directly. In
searching for the Solar family, we would also identify many thousands of
other chemically homogeneous groups, providing a wealth of additional
information. We discuss this prospect in the context of the upcoming
HERMES high-resolution million-star survey.

temperature, metallicity, and projected rotational velocity for the host
stars of 56 transiting planets. Our analysis is based primarily on the
stellar parameter classification (SPC) technique. We investigate
systematic errors by examining subsets of the data with two other
methods that have often been used in previous studies (Spectroscopy Made
Easy (SME) and MOOG). The SPC and SME results, both based on comparisons
between synthetic spectra and actual spectra, show strong correlations
between T $_{eff}$, [Fe/H], and log g when solving for all three
quantities simultaneously. In contrast the MOOG results, based on a more
traditional curve-of-growth approach, show no such correlations. To
combat the correlations and improve the accuracy of the temperatures and
metallicities, we repeat the SPC analysis with a constraint on log g
based on the mean stellar density that can be derived from the analysis
of the transit light curves. Previous studies that have not taken
advantage of this constraint have been subject to systematic errors in
the stellar masses and radii of up to 20\% and 10\%, respectively, which
can be larger than other observational uncertainties, and which also
cause systematic errors in the planetary mass and radius.

93 per cent fraction of Population I stars, only 22 sources (5 per cent)
are Population II stars, and 9 sources (2 per cent) are
intermediate-disc stars. No source belongs to the halo. By following the
mass of the stars instead of their light, the resulting subset of 136
long-lived stars distributes as 22 (16.2 per cent):6 (4.4 per cent):108
(79.4 per cent) for the Population II:intermediate disc:Population I,
respectively. Along with the much larger scaleheight reached by
Population II, this unbiased census of long-lived stars provides plain
evidence for a starburst epoch in the early Milky Way, with the
formation of a massive, rotationally supported, and dark Population II.
The same conclusion arises from the substantial early chemical
enrichment levels, exemplified here by the elements magnesium and iron,
as it arises also from the local Population II white dwarfs. The
kinematics, metallicity distribution functions, star formation rates,
age-metallicity relations, the inventory of young stars, and the
occurrence of blue straggler stars are discussed. A potentially new
aspect of the survey is the possibility for substructure among the local
Population II stars that may further subdivide into metal-poor and

previous results that have been presented for various subsets of this

multiplicities with primary mass. We find for the F- and G-type
Population I stars that 58\% are non-single and 21\% are in triple or
higher level systems. For the old intermediate-disk and Population II
stars{\mdash}virtually all of G type and less massive{\mdash}even two out
of three sources prove to be non-single. These numbers being lower
limits because of the continuous flow of new discoveries, the unbiased
survey clearly demonstrates that the standard case for solar-type field
stars is a hydrogen-burning source with at least one ordinary or
degenerate stellar companion, and a surprisingly large number of stars
are organized in multiple systems. A principal consequence is that
orbital evolution, including the formation of blue straggler stars, is a
potentially important issue on all spatial scales and timescales for a
significant percentage of the stellar systems, in particular among
Population II stars. We discuss a number of recent observations of known

	Abstract = {{The Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE) is a
high-resolution infrared spectroscopic survey spanning all Galactic
environments (i.e., bulge, disk, and halo), with the principal goal of
constraining dynamical and chemical evolution models of the Milky Way.
APOGEE takes advantage of the reduced effects of extinction at infrared
wavelengths to observe the inner Galaxy and bulge at an unprecedented
level of detail. The survey's broad spatial and wavelength coverage
enables users of APOGEE data to address numerous Galactic structure and
stellar populations issues. In this paper we describe the APOGEE
targeting scheme and document its various target classes to provide the
necessary background and reference information to analyze samples of
APOGEE data with awareness of the imposed selection criteria and
resulting sample properties. APOGEE's primary sample consists of
\~{}10$^{5}$ red giant stars, selected to minimize observational
biases in age and metallicity. We present the methodology and
considerations that drive the selection of this sample and evaluate the
accuracy, efficiency, and caveats of the selection and sampling
algorithms. We also describe additional target classes that contribute
to the APOGEE sample, including numerous ancillary science programs, and
we outline the targeting data that will be included in the public data
releases.

The barium abundance was estimated using non-local thermodynamic

the trend of yttrium and barium abundances as a function of distance in

@article{McMillan2008,
	Abstract = {{Angle-action coordinates are used to study the relic of an N-body
simulation of a self-gravitating satellite galaxy that was released on a
short-period orbit within the disc of the Galaxy. Satellite stars that
lie within 1.5kpc of the Sun are confined to a grid of patches in action
space. As the relic phase mixes for longer, the patches become smaller
and more numerous. These patches can be seen even when the angle-action
coordinates of an erroneous Galactic potential are used, but using the
wrong potential displaces them. Diagnostic quantities constructed from
the angle coordinates both allow the true potential to be identified,
and the relic to be dated. Hence, when the full phase space coordinates
of large numbers of solar-neighbourhood stars are known, it should be
possible to identify members of particular relics from the distribution
of stars in an approximate action space. This would then open up the
possibility of determining the time since the relic was disrupted and
gaining better knowledge of the Galactic potential.

The availability of angle-action coordinates for arbitrary potentials is
the key to these developments. The paper includes a brief introduction
to the torus technique used to generate them.

result from the use of a 3D hydrodynamic model of the solar atmosphere

departures from LTE, and improved atomic and molecular data. With these
abundances, the new solar metallicity, Z, decreases to Z=0.012, almost a

@article{Spite1982,
	Abstract = {{High resolution spectra with high signal-to-noise ratios (typically 100)
have been obtained for a few halo dwarfs with the 3$^{m}$.6 CFH
telescope. These solar type stars are very old and extremely metal poor.
The Li resonance line ({$\lambda$}6707) is observed, and is essentially
produced by the $^{7}$Li isotope.

Although the mean metal abundance M/H varies from a factor t2 to 250
relative to the Sun, the abundance of lithium is very constant in all
these stars, but the coolest ones where the convection zone is deep
enough to induce $^{7}$Li destruction by proton fusion.

The non-destruction of $^{7}$Li in very old halo stars (of about
the solar type) is to be attributed to the reduction of the size of the
convective zone, reduction caused by the very small abundance of the
heavy elements.

If the problem seems clear for the halo stars it is on the contrary very
confusing in Population I stars. It seems however that in the old disk
stars the destruction of lithium is also inhibited, probably also by a
reduction of the depth of the convective zone due to the slight metal
deficiency. It is pointed out, on the other hand, that among G type
stars of Population I more than a half have a lithium abundance similar
to that of the Hyades, although probably not half of them are as young
as the Hyades.

It is suggested that the destruction of lithium in solar type stars is
sometimes accelerated by the action of another process such as
overshooting or turbulent diffusion, which is not always present.

We admit that the shape of the distribution of Li abundance in the
Pleiades after Duncan (t98 t) rules out a significant destruction of
lithium in the protostellar phase for solar type stars.  Depletion of
Lithium in halo stars by other processes is discussed and found
unlikely. After discussion it is suggested that the abundance of lithium
in halo dwarfs is therefore representative of the abundance of the
interstellar matter which formed the stars and also that this matter
itself retains the lithium abundances of the Big Bang, hardly altered.

We deduce a primordial value of the lithium abundance 11.2
10$^{-11}$ N$_{H}$ (or, by mass X$_{Li}$ = 5.96
10$^{-10}$).

The baryonic density of the Universe deduced from this value is compared
to the densities deduced from the primordial abundance of deuterium and
helium. All these densities are small, and this show that the Universe
cannot be closed by nucleons.

plane. The gravities have statistical errors sigma(log g) $\lt$ 0.20 dex
and systematic errors within +/- 0.10 dex. Comparison with gravities,
derived from the requirement that FeI and FeII lines should provide the
same iron abundance, shows that such `spectroscopic' gravities are often
in error by a factor of 2 to 3. The importance of the parallax-based
gravities for setting the metallicity scale of metal-poor stars and for

	Abstract = {{In the Milky Way, the thick disk can be defined using individual stellar
abundances, kinematics, or age, or geometrically, as stars high above
the midplane. In nearby galaxies, where only a geometric definition can
be used, thick disks appear to have large radial scale lengths, and
their red colors suggest that they are uniformly old. The Milky
Way{\rsquo}s geometrically thick disk is also radially extended, but it
is far from chemically uniform: {$\alpha$}-enhanced stars are confined
within the inner Galaxy. In simulated galaxies, where old stars are
centrally concentrated, geometrically thick disks are radially extended,
too. Younger stellar populations flare in the simulated disks{\rsquo}
outer regions, bringing those stars high above the midplane. The
resulting geometrically thick disks therefore show a radial age
gradient, from old in their central regions to younger in their
outskirts. Based on our age estimates for a large sample of giant stars
in the APOGEE survey, we can now test this scenario for the Milky Way.
We find that the geometrically defined thick disk in the Milky Way has
indeed a strong radial age gradient: the median age for red clump stars
goes from {\sim}9 Gyr in the inner disk to 5 Gyr in the outer disk. We
propose that at least some nearby galaxies could also have thick disks
that are not uniformly old, and that geometrically thick disks might be
complex structures resulting from different formation mechanisms in
their inner and outer parts.

can account for a number of chemo-kinematic relations in the Milky Way.
In addition, we demonstrate that (1) our model matches well the observed
age-[{$\alpha$}/Fe] and age-[Fe/H] relations and (2) that the scatter in the
age-[Fe/H] relation cannot be simply explained by blurring (stars on
apo- and pericenters visiting the solar vicinity) but significant radial
migration (stars born elsewhere but ending up at the solar vicinity
today because of a change in guiding radius) is needed. We emphasize the
importance of accurate stellar ages, such as those obtained through
asteroseismology by the CoRoT and Kepler missions, for breaking the
degeneracy among different Galactic evolution scenarios.

	Abstract = {{Observational tests of stellar and Galactic chemical evolution call for
the joint knowledge of a star's physical parameters, detailed element
abundances, and precise age. For cool main-sequence (MS) stars the
abundances of many elements can be measured from spectroscopy, but ages
are very hard to determine. The situation is different if the MS star
has a white dwarf (WD) companion and a known distance, as the age of
such a binary system can then be determined precisely from the
photometric properties of the cooling WD. As a pilot study for obtaining
precise age determinations of field MS stars, we identify nearly one
hundred candidates for such wide binary systems: a faint WD whose GPS1
proper motion matches that of a brighter MS star in Gaia/TGAS with a
good parallax ($\sigma\_\varpi/\varpi\le 0.05$). We model the WD's
multi-band photometry with the BASE-9 code using this precise distance
(assumed to be common for the pair) and infer ages for each binary
system. The resulting age estimates are precise to $\le 10\\%$ ($\le
20\\%$) for $42$ ($67$) MS-WD systems. Our analysis more than doubles the
number of MS-WD systems with precise distances known to date, and it
boosts the number of such systems with precise age determination by an
order of magnitude. With the advent of the Gaia DR2 data, this approach
will be applicable to a far larger sample, providing ages for many MS
stars (that can yield detailed abundances for over 20 elements),
especially in the age range 2 to 8$\backslash$,$\backslash$Gyr, where there are only few known
star clusters.

	Abstract = {{Context: The evolution of C and O abundances in the Milky Way can impose
strong constraints on stellar nucleosynthesis and help in understanding
the formation and evolution of our Galaxy.  <BR />Aims: The aim of this
paper is to review the measured C and O abundances in the disk and bulge
of the Galaxy and compare the results to predictions of Galactic
chemical evolution models.  <BR />Methods: We adopt two successful
chemical evolution models for the bulge and the disk, respectively. They
assume the same nucleosynthesis prescriptions but different histories of
star formation. <BR />Results: The data show a clear distinction between
the trend of [C/O] in the thick and thin Galactic disks, while the thick
disk and bulge trends are indistinguishable with a large ($\gt$0.5 dex)
increase in the [C/O] ratio in the range from -0.1 to +0.4 dex for
[O/H]. In our models we consider yields from massive stars with and
without the inclusion of metallicity-dependent stellar winds. The
observed increase in the [C/O] with metallicity in the bulge and thick
disk lies between the predictions utilizing mass-loss rates of Maeder
and Meynet {\amp} Maeder. A model without metallicity-dependent yields
completely fails to match the observations. Thus, the relative increase
in carbon abundance at high metallicity appears to come from
metallicity-dependent stellar winds in massive stars. These results also
explain the steep decline of the [O/Fe] ratio with [Fe/H] in the
Galactic bulge, while the [Mg/Fe] ratio is enhanced at all [Fe/H].  <BR
/>Conclusions: We conclude that data and models are consistent with a
rapid bulge and thick disk formation timescales, and with
metallicity-dependent yields for C and O. The observed too high [C/O]
ratios at low metallicity in the bulge may stem from an unaccounted
source of carbon: very fast rotating metal poor stars, or metal-poor
binary systems whose envelopes were stripped by Roche lobe overflow.

	Abstract = {{In the first paper of this series, we present a new approach for
studying the chemo-dynamical evolution in disk galaxies, which consists
of fusing disk chemical evolution models with compatible numerical
simulations of galactic disks. This method avoids known star formation
and chemical enrichment problems encountered in simulations. Here we
focus on the Milky Way, by using a detailed thin-disk chemical evolution
model (matching local observables, which are weakly affected by radial
migration) and a simulation in the cosmological context, with dynamical
properties close to those of our Galaxy. We examine in detail the
interplay between in situ chemical enrichment and radial migration and
their impact on key observables in the solar neighborhood, e.g., the
age-metallicity-velocity relation, the metallicity distribution, and
gradients in the radial and vertical directions. We show that, due to
radial migration from mergers at high redshift and the central bar at
later times, a sizable fraction of old metal-poor high-[{$\alpha$}/Fe]
stars can reach the solar vicinity. This naturally accounts for a number
of recent observations related to both the thin and thick disks, despite
the fact that we use thin-disk chemistry only. Although significant
radial mixing is present, the slope in the age-metallicity relation is
only weakly affected, with a scatter compatible with recent
observational work. While we find a smooth density distribution in the
[O/Fe]-[Fe/H] plane, we can recover the observed discontinuity by
selecting particles according to kinematic criteria used in
high-resolution samples to define the thin and thick disks. We outline a
new method for estimating the birth place of the Sun and predict that
the most likely radius lies in the range 4.4 $\lt$ r $\lt$ 7.7 kpc (for a
current location at r = 8 kpc). A new, unifying model for the Milky Way
thick disk is offered, where both mergers and radial migration play a
role at different stages of the disk evolution. We show that in the
absence of early-on massive mergers the vertical velocity dispersion of
the oldest stars is underestimated by a factor of \~{}2 compared with
observations. We can, therefore, argue that the Milky Way thick disk is
unlikely to have been formed through a quiescent disk evolution. An
observational test involving both chemical and kinematic information
must be devised to ascertain this possibility.

SN I, and SN II represent the deaths of stars in the mutually exclusive
mass ranges below 4 solar masses, from 4 to 6.5 solar masses, and above
6.5 solar masses, respectively. Consequences of tentative assumptions
based partly on empirical evidence for iron production by SN I and
carbon production by low-mass stars are tested against published stellar
abundances. From a variety of models for chemical abundances, it is
found that the relative abundances of primary elements are essentially
functions of time, determined by progenitor stellar lifetimes, although
the absolute abundance levels depend mainly on the model parameters.

metallicity-planet correlation, namely for very low mass planets. The
results presented here suggest that in contrast to their jovian
couterparts, neptune-like planets do not form preferentially around
metal-rich stars. The ratio of jupiter-to-neptunes is also an increasing
function of stellar metallicity. These results are discussed in the

excellent agreement with the solar value. We determine stellar

derive a cluster mean value of [Fe/H]=0.16+/-0.02 ({$\sigma$}=0.1), in good
agreement with previous studies. For stars cooler than 4700 K, we find
that the abundance of Fe from ionized lines exceeds the abundance of Fe
from neutral lines. At 4700 K,
[Fe/H]$_{II}$-[Fe/H]$_{I}$\~{}=0.3dex, while at 4000 K
[Fe/H]$_{II}$-[Fe/H]$_{I}$\~{}=1.2dex. This discrepancy between
the Fe abundance from neutral and ionized lines likely reflects
inadequacies in the model atmospheres and the presence of non-LTE or
other effects. Despite the inability of the models to reproduce the
ionization equilibrium for Fe, the Mg isotope ratios appear immune to
these problems and remain a powerful tool for studying Galactic chemical
evolution.

critical for understanding their compositions and formation mechanisms.
To know the planet, we must know the host star in as much detail as
possible. We present first results from the K2-HERMES project, which
uses the HERMES multi-object spectrograph on the Anglo-Australian
Telescope to obtain R {\sim} 28000 spectra of up to 360 stars in one
exposure. This ongoing project aims to derive self-consistent
spectroscopic parameters for about half of K2 target stars. We present
complete stellar parameters and isochrone-derived masses and radii for
46 stars hosting 57 K2 candidate planets in Campaigns 1{\ndash}3. Our
revised host-star radii cast severe doubt on three candidate planets:
EPIC 201407812.01, EPIC 203070421.01, and EPIC 202843107.01, all of
which now have inferred radii well in excess of the largest known
inflated Jovian planets.

	Abstract = {{<BR /> Aims: The nature of the thick disc and its relation to the thin
disc is presently an important subject of debate. In fact, the
structural and chemo-dynamical transition between disc populations can
be used as a test of the proposed models of Galactic disc formation and
evolution. <BR /> Methods: We used the atmospheric parameters,
[{$\alpha$}/Fe] abundances, and radial velocities, which were determined
from the Gaia-ESO Survey GIRAFFE spectra of FGK-type stars (first nine
months of observations) to provide a chemo-kinematical characterisation
of the disc stellar populations. We focussed on a subsample of 1016
stars with high-quality parameters, covering the volume | Z | $\lt$ 4.5
kpc and R in the range 2-13 kpc. <BR /> Results: We have identified a
thin to thick disc separation in the [{$\alpha$}/Fe] vs. [M/H] plane,
thanks to the presence of a low-density region in the number density
distribution. The thick disc stars seem to lie in progressively thinner
layers above the Galactic plane, as metallicity increases and
[{$\alpha$}/Fe] decreases. In contrast, the thin disc population presents a
constant value of the mean distance to the Galactic plane at all
metallicities. In addition, our data confirm the already known
correlations between V$_{phi}$ and [M/H] for the two discs. For
the thick disc sequence, a study of the possible contamination by thin
disc stars suggests a gradient up to 64 {\plusmn} 9 km s$^{-1}$
dex$^{-1}$. The distributions of azimuthal velocity, vertical
velocity, and orbital parameters are also analysed for the chemically
separated samples. Concerning the gradients with galactocentric radius,
we find, for the thin disc, a flat behaviour of the azimuthal velocity,
a metallicity gradient equal to -0.058 {\plusmn} 0.008 dex
kpc$^{-1}$ and a very small positive [{$\alpha$}/Fe] gradient. For
the thick disc, flat gradients in [M/H] and [{$\alpha$}/Fe] are derived.
<BR /> Conclusions: Our chemo-kinematical analysis suggests a picture
where the thick disc seems to have experienced a settling process,
during which its rotation increased progressively and, possibly, the
azimuthal velocity dispersion decreased. At [M/H] {\ap} -0.25 dex and
[{$\alpha$}/Fe]{\ap} 0.1 dex, the mean characteristics of the thick disc in
vertical distance to the Galactic plane, rotation, rotational
dispersion, and stellar orbits' eccentricity agree with that of the thin
disc stars of the same metallicity, suggesting a possible connection
between these two populations at a certain epoch of the disc evolution.
Finally, the results presented here, based only on the first months of
the Gaia ESO Survey observations, confirm how crucial large
high-resolution spectroscopic surveys outside the solar neighbourhood
are today for our understanding of the Milky Way history.

	Abstract = {{The Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope (LAMOST,
also called the Guo Shou Jing Telescope) is a special reflecting Schmidt
telescope. LAMOST's special design allows both a large aperture
(effective aperture of 3.6 m-4.9 m) and a wide field of view (FOV)
(5{\deg}). It has an innovative active reflecting Schmidt configuration
which continuously changes the mirror's surface that adjusts during the
observation process and combines thin deformable mirror active optics
with segmented active optics. Its primary mirror (6.67 m {\times} 6.05 m)
and active Schmidt mirror (5.74m {\times} 4.40m) are both segmented, and
composed of 37 and 24 hexagonal sub-mirrors respectively. By using a
parallel controllable fiber positioning technique, the focal surface of
1.75 m in diameter can accommodate 4000 optical fibers. Also, LAMOST has
16 spectrographs with 32 CCD cameras. LAMOST will be the telescope with
the highest rate of spectral acquisition. As a national large scientific
project, the LAMOST project was formally proposed in 1996, and approved
by the Chinese government in 1997. The construction started in 2001, was
completed in 2008 and passed the official acceptance in June 2009. The
LAMOST pilot survey was started in October 2011 and the spectroscopic
survey will launch in September 2012. Up to now, LAMOST has released
more than 480000 spectra of objects. LAMOST will make an important
contribution to the study of the large-scale structure of the Universe,
structure and evolution of the Galaxy, and cross-identification of
multi-waveband properties in celestial objects.

	Abstract = {{We use about 200,000 FGK-type main-sequence stars from the LAMOST DR1
data to map the local stellar kinematics. With the velocity deprojection
technique, we are able to derive the averaged three-dimensional velocity
and velocity ellipsoids using only the line-of-sight velocity for the
stars with various effective temperatures within 100$\backslash$lt | z| $\backslash$lt 500 pc.
Using the mean velocities of the cool stars, we derive the solar motion
of ($\{$U$\}$$_{&sun; }$, $\{$V$\}$$_{&sun; }$, $\{$W$\}$$_{&sun; }$)
= (9.58 {\plusmn} 2.39, 10.52 {\plusmn} 1.96, 7.01 {\plusmn} 1.67) $\{$km$\}$
$\{$$\{$$\{$s$\}$$\}$$\}$$^{-1}$ with respect to the local standard of rest.
Moreover, we find that the stars with $\{$T$\}$$_{{eff}$$\}$  $\backslash$gt  6000 K
show a net asymmetric motion of {\tilde}3  $\{$km$\}$ $\{$$\{$$\{$s$\}$$\}$$\}$$^{-1}$ in
$\lt$ W$\gt$  compared to the stars with $\{$T$\}$$_{{eff}$$\}$  $\backslash$lt  6000 K.
And their azimuthal velocity increases when | z|  increases. This
peculiar motion in the warmer stars is likely because they are young and
not completely relaxed, although other reasons, such as the resonance
induced by the central rotating bar or the spiral structures and the
perturbation of the merging dwarf galaxies, cannot be ruled out. The
derived velocity dispersions and cross-terms for the data are
approximately consistent with previous studies. We also find that the
vertical gradients of $\{${$\sigma$} $\}$$_{U}$ and $\{${$\sigma$} $\}$$_{V}$
are larger than that of $\{${$\sigma$} $\}$$_{W}$. And the vertical
gradient of $\{${$\sigma$} $\}$$_{U}$ shows a clear correlation with
$\{$T$\}$$_{{eff}$$\}$, while the other two do not. Finally, our sample
shows a vertex deviation of about 11\^{}$\backslash$circ  at 300$\backslash$lt | z| $\backslash$lt 500 pc,
but roughly zero at 100$\backslash$lt | z| $\backslash$lt 300 pc.

	Abstract = {We demonstrate a new approach to calibrating the spectral-spatial response of a wide-field spectrograph using a fibre etalon comb. Conventional wide-field instruments employed on front-line telescopes are mapped with a grid of diffraction-limited holes cut into a focal plane mask. The aberrated grid pattern in the image plane typically reveals n-symmetric (e.g. pincushion) distortion patterns over the field arising from the optical train. This approach is impractical in the presence of a dispersing element because the diffraction-limited spots in the focal plane are imaged as an array of overlapping spectra. Instead, we propose a compact solution that builds on recent developments in fibre-based, Fabry-Perot etalons. We introduce a novel approach to near-field illumination that exploits a 20cm aperture commercial telescope and the propagation of skew rays in a multimode fibre. The mapping of the optical transfer function across the full field is represented accurately ({\textless}0.5{\%} rms residual) by an orthonormal set of Chebyshev moments. Thus we are able to reconstruct the full 4K x 4K CCD image of the dispersed output from the optical fibres using this mapping, as we demonstrate. Our method targets one of the largest sources of systematic error in multi-object spectroscopy, i.e. spectral distortion due to instrumental aberrations, and provides a comprehensive solution to their calibration and removal.},

Bright source extractions have 1 $\sigma$ photometric uncertainty of {\textless}0.03 mag and astrometric accuracy of order 100 mas. Calibration offsets between any two points in the sky are {\textless}0.02 mag.

was an approximately $12 million dollar project to provide a new
facility class instrument for the Anglo-Australian Telescope (AAT). It
was commissioned in Q4 2013. This paper examines how software challenges
presented by HERMES were handled, including: minimizing cost through
reusing the existing AAT 2dF/AAOmega facility software as far as
possible; using instrument and data simulators to ensure new software
was almost ready before any hardware had been seen; extensive upgrading
of our fiber data reduction software; dealing with the tighter
calibration and alignment tolerances of a high-resolution spectrograph.

@article{Lewis2002,
	Abstract = {{The 2dF (Two-degree Field) facility at the prime focus of the
Anglo-Australian Telescope provides multiple-object spectroscopy over a
2{\deg} field of view. Up to 400 target fibres can be independently
positioned by a complex robot. Two spectrographs provide spectra with
resolutions of between 500 and 2000, over wavelength ranges of 440 and
110nm respectively. The 2dF facility began routine observations in 1997.
2dF was designed primarily for galaxy redshift surveys and has a number
of innovative features. The large corrector lens incorporates an
atmospheric dispersion compensator, essential for wide wavelength
coverage with small-diameter fibres. The instrument has two full sets of
fibres on separate field plates, so that re-configuring can be done in
parallel with observing. The robot positioner places one fibre every 6s,
to a precision of 0.3arcsec (20{$\mu$}m) over the full field. All
components of 2dF, including the spectrographs, are mounted on a 5-m
diameter telescope top end ring for ease of handling and to keep the
optical fibres short in order to maximize UV throughput. There is a
pipeline data reduction system which allows each data set to be fully
analysed while the next field is being observed. 2dF has achieved its
initial astronomical goals. The redshift surveys obtain spectra at the
rate of 2500 galaxies per night, yielding a total of about 200000
objects in the first four years. Typically a B=19 galaxy gives a
spectrum with a signal-to-noise ratio of better than 10 per pixel in
less than an hour; redshifts are derived for about 95 per cent of all
galaxies, with 99 per cent reliability or better. Total system
throughput is about 5 per cent. The failure rate of the positioner and
fibre system is about 1:10000 moves or once every few nights, and
recovery time is usually short. In this paper we provide the historical

@article{Miszalski2006,
	Abstract = {{Multi-object spectroscopy (MOS) instruments, such as the Two-degree
Field (2dF) facility of the Anglo-Australian Observatory (AAO), have
facilitated large-scale redshift surveys. Yet despite their acclaim,
instrument design has been suspected of introducing subtle selection
effects into surveys. Investigation into these selection effects has
been overshadowed by instrument complexity. We identify the field
configuration algorithm (FCA) used to select targets for observation as
mainly responsible for such effects. An FCA can imprint artificial
structure on observed target distributions, which may accrue over large
angular scales, potentially to the detriment of statistical analyses
applied to such surveys. We present here a new FCA developed for 2dF
that is based on simulated annealing (SA), a generic method commonly
used to solve constrained optimization problems. We generate synthetic
fields and utilize mock 2dF volumes to contrast the behaviour of
previous strategies with the SA FCA. The angular two-point correlation
function and other sensitive techniques reveal that the new FCA achieves
unprecedented sampling uniformity and target yield with improved target
priority handling and observational flexibility over current FCAs. The
SA FCA is generic enough to be used by current 2dF-like and potentially
next-generation MOS instruments with little modification.

	Abstract = {We present a new technique called "{t-SNE}" that visualizes high-dimensional data by giving each datapoint a location in a two or three-dimensional map. The technique is a variation of Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (Hinton and Roweis, 2002) that is much easier to optimize, and produces significantly better visualizations by reducing the tendency to crowd points together in the center of the map. {t-SNE} is better than existing techniques at creating a single map that reveals structure at many different scales. This is particularly important for high-dimensional data that lie on several different, but related, low-dimensional manifolds, such as images ofobjects from multiple classes seen from multiple viewpoints. For visualizing the structure of very large data sets, we show how {t-SNE} can use random walks on neighborhood graphs to allow the implicit structure of all of the data to influence the way in which a subset of the data is displayed. We illustrate the performance of {t-SNE} on a wide variety of data sets and compare it with many other non-parametric visualization techniques, including Sammon mapping, Isomap, and Locally Linear Embedding. The visualizations produced by {t-SNE} are significantly better than those produced by the other techniques on almost all of the data sets.},

	Abstract = {Clustering algorithms are attractive for the task of class identification in spatial databases. However, the application to large spatial databases rises the following requirements for clustering algorithms: minimal requirements of domain knowledge to determine the input parameters, discovery of clusters with arbitrary shape and good efficiency on large databases. The well-known clustering algorithms offer no solution to the combination of these requirements. In this paper, we present the new clustering algorithm {DBSCAN} relying on a density-based notion of clusters which is designed to discover clusters of arbitrary shape. {DBSCAN} requires only one input parameter and supports the user in determining an appropriate value for it. We performed an experimental evaluation of the effectiveness and efficiency of {DBSCAN} using synthetic data and real data of the {SEQUOIA} 2000 benchmark. The results of our experiments demonstrate that (1) {DBSCAN} is significantly more effective in discovering clusters of arbitrary shape than the well-known algorithm {CLAR}-{ANS}, and that (2) {DBSCAN} outperforms {CLARANS} by a factor of more than 100 in terms of efficiency.},

@article{Haywood2008b,
	Abstract = {{The analysis of the kinematics of solar neighbourhood stars shows that
the low- and high-metallicity tails of the thin disc are populated by
objects which orbital properties suggest an origin in the outer and
inner Galactic disc, respectively. Signatures of radial migration are
identified in various recent samples, and are shown to be responsible
for the high-metallicity dispersion in the age-metallicity distribution.
Most importantly, it is shown that the population of low-metallicity
wanderers of the thin disc (-0.7 $\lt$ [Fe/H] $\lt$ -0.3 dex) is also
responsible for the apparent hiatus in metallicity with the thick disc
(which terminal metallicity is about -0.2 dex). It implies that the thin
disc at the solar circle has started to form stars at about this same
metallicity. This is also consistent with the fact that `transition'
objects, which have {$\alpha$}-element abundance intermediate between that
of the thick and thin discs, are found in the range [-0.4, -0.2] dex.
Once the metal-poor thin disc stars are recognized for what they are -
wanderers from the outer thin disc - the parenthood between the two
discs can be identified on stars genuinely formed at the solar circle
through an evolutionary sequence in [{$\alpha$}/Fe] and [Fe/H]. Another
consequence is that stars that can be considered as truly resulting of
the chemical evolution at the solar circle have a metallicity restricted
to about [-0.2, +0.2] dex, confirming an old idea that most chemical
evolution in the Milky Way have preceded the thin disc formation.

@article{Adibekyan2013,
	Abstract = {{<BR /> Aims: We analyzed chemical and kinematical properties of about
850 FGK solar neighborhood long-lived dwarfs observed with the HARPS
high-resolution spectrograph. The stars in the sample have log g {\ge} 4
dex, 5000 {\le} T$_{eff}$ {\le} 6500 K, and - 1.39 {\le} [Fe/H] {\le}
0.55 dex. The aim of this study is to characterize and explore the
kinematics and chemical properties of stellar populations of the Galaxy
in order to understand their origins and evolution. <BR /> Methods: We
applied a purely chemical analysis approach based on the [{$\alpha$}/Fe]
vs. [Fe/H] plot to separate Galactic stellar populations into the thin
disk, thick disk, and high-{$\alpha$} metal-rich (h{$\alpha$}mr). Then, we
explored the population's stellar orbital eccentricity distributions,
their correlation with metallicity, and rotational velocity gradients
with metallicity in the Galactic disks to provide constraints on the
various formation models. <BR /> Results: We identified a gap in the
[{$\alpha$}/Fe]-[Fe/H] plane for the {$\alpha$}-enhanced stars, and by
performing a bootstrapped Monte Carlo test we obtained a probability
higher than 99.99\% that this gap is not due to small-number statistics.
Our analysis shows a negative gradient of the rotational velocity of the
thin disk stars with [Fe/H] (-17 km s$^{-1}$ dex$^{-1}$),
and a steep positive gradient for both the thick disk and h{$\alpha$}mr
stars with the same magnitude of about +42 km s$^{-1}$
dex$^{-1}$. For the thin disk stars we observed no correlation
between orbital eccentricities and metallicity, but observed a steep
negative gradient for the thick disk and h{$\alpha$}mr stars with
practically the same magnitude ({\ap}-0.18 dex$^{-1}$). The
correlations observed for the nearby stars (on average 45 pc) using
high-precision data, in general agree well with the results obtained for
the SDSS sample of stars located farther from the Galactic plane. <BR />
Conclusions: Our results suggest that radial migration played an
important role in the formation and evolution of the thin disk. For the
thick disk stars it is not possible to reach a firm conclusion about
their origin. Based on the eccentricity distribution of the thick disk
stars only their accretion origin can be ruled out, and the heating and
migration scenario could explain the positive steep gradient of
V$_{phi}$ with [Fe/H]. When we analyzed the h{$\alpha$}mr stellar
population we found that they share properties of both the thin and
thick disk population. A comparison of the properties of the h{$\alpha$}mr
stars with those of the subsample of stars from the N-body/SPH
simulation using radial migration suggest that they may have originated
from the inner Galaxy. Further detailed investigations would help to
clarify their exact nature and origin.

used a model of the Ba atom with 31 levels of Ba I and 101 levels of Ba

the ATLAS9 code modified by new opacity distribution functions by
Castelli {\amp} Kurucz. The NLTE profiles of the unblended Ba II (4554,

The line 6141 {\AA} was also used, but with an allowance for its
correlation with the iron line. The average barium abundances in the
thin and thick discs are 0.01 {\plusmn} 0.08 and -0.03 {\plusmn} 0.07,
respectively. The comparison to the calculations of the Galactic

	Abstract = {{We report the discovery of a trend of increasing barium abundance with
decreasing age for a large sample of Galactic open clusters. The
observed pattern of [Ba/Fe] versus age can be reproduced with a Galactic
chemical evolution model only assuming a higher Ba yield from the
s-process in low-mass stars than the average one suggested by
parameterized models of neutron-capture nucleosynthesis. We show that
this is possible in a scenario where the efficiency of the extra-mixing
processes producing the neutron source $^{13}$C is anticorrelated
with the initial mass, with a larger efficiency for lower masses. This
is similar to the known trend of extended mixing episodes acting in
H-rich layers and might suggest a common physical mechanism.

	Abstract = {{In a recent study based on homogeneous barium abundance measurements in
open clusters (OCs), a trend of increasing [Ba/Fe] ratios for decreasing
cluster age was reported. We present here further abundance
determinations, relative to four other elements having important
s-process contributions, with the aim of investigating whether or not
the growth found for [Ba/Fe] is indicative of a general property, shared
also by the other heavy elements formed by slow neutron captures. In
particular, we derived abundances for yttrium, zirconium, lanthanum, and
cerium, using equivalent width measurements and the MOOG code. Our
sample includes 19 OCs of different ages, for which the spectra were
obtained by the ESO Very Large Telescope using the UVES spectrometer.
The growth previously suggested for Ba is confirmed for all the elements
analyzed in our study. This fact implies significant changes in our
views of the Galactic chemical evolution for elements beyond iron. Our
results necessarily require that very low mass asymptotic giant branch
stars (Mlap1.5 M $_{sun}$) produce larger amounts of s-process
elements (and hence activate the $^{13}$C-neutron source more
effectively) than previously expected. Their role in producing
neutron-rich elements in the Galactic disk has been so far
underestimated, and their evolution and neutron-capture nucleosynthesis
should now be reconsidered.

@article{Travaglio2004,
	Abstract = {{In this paper we follow the Galactic enrichment of three easily observed
light n-capture elements: Sr, Y, and Zr. Input stellar yields have been
first separated into their respective main and weak s-process components
and r-process component. The s-process yields from asymptotic giant
branch (AGB) stars of low to intermediate mass are computed, exploring a
wide range of efficiencies of the major neutron source, $^{13}$C,
and covering both disk and halo metallicities. AGB stars have been shown
to reproduce the main s-component in the solar system, i.e., the
s-process isotopic distribution of all heavy isotopes with atomic mass
number A$\gt$90, with a minor contribution to the light s-process
isotopes up to A\~{}90. The concurrent weak s-process, which accounts for
the major fraction of the light s-process isotopes in the solar system
and occurs in massive stars by the operation of the $^{22}$Ne
neutron source, is discussed in detail. Neither the main s- nor the weak
s-components are shown to contribute significantly to the
neutron-capture element abundances observed in unevolved halo stars.
Knowing the s-process distribution at the epoch of the solar system
formation, we first employed the r-process residuals method to infer the
isotopic distribution of the r-process. We assumed a primary r-process
production in the Galaxy from moderately massive Type II supernovae that
best reproduces the observational Galactic trend of metallicity versus
Eu, an almost pure r-process element. We present a detailed analysis of
a large published database of spectroscopic observations of Sr, Y, Zr,
Ba, and Eu for Galactic stars at various metallicities, showing that the
observed trends versus metallicity can be understood in light of a
multiplicity of stellar neutron-capture components. Spectroscopic
observations of the Sr, Y, and Zr to Ba and Eu abundance ratios versus
metallicity provide useful diagnostics of the types of neutron-capture
processes forming Sr, Y, and Zr. In particular, the observed [Sr, Y,
Zr/Ba, Eu] ratio is clearly not flat at low metallicities, as we would
expect if Ba, Eu and Sr, Y, Zr all had the same r-process
nucleosynthetic origin. We discuss our chemical evolution predictions,
taking into account the interplay between different processes to produce
Sr-Y-Zr. Making use of the very r-process-rich and very metal-poor stars
like CS 22892-052 and CS 31082-001, we find hints and discuss the
possibility of a primary process in low-metallicity massive stars,
different from the ``classical s-process'' and from the ``classical
r-process'' that we tentatively define LEPP (lighter element primary
process). This allows us to revise the estimates of the r-process
contributions to the solar Sr, Y, and Zr abundances, as well as of the
contribution to the s-only isotopes $^{86}$Sr, $^{87}$Sr,
and $^{96}$Mo.

	Abstract = {{For the first time, we present an extensive study of stars with
individual non-LTE (NLTE) abundances for 17 chemical elements from Li to
Eu in a sample of stars uniformly distributed over the -2.62 {\le} [Fe/H]
{\le} +0.24 metallicity range that is suitable for the Galactic chemical
evolution research. The star sample has been kinematically selected to
trace the Galactic thin and thick disks and halo. We find new results
and improve earlier ones as follows: (I) the element-to-iron ratios for
Mg, Si, Ca, and Ti form a metal-poor (MP) plateau at a similar height of
0.3 dex, and the knee occurs at common [Fe/H] {\sime} -0.8. The knee at
the same metallicity is observed for [O/Fe], and the MP plateau is
formed at [O/Fe] = 0.61. (II) The upward trend of [C/O] with decreasing
metallicity exists at [Fe/H] $\lt$ -1.2, supporting the earlier finding
of Akerman et al. (III) An underabundance of Na relative to Mg in the
[Fe/H] $\lt$ -1 stars is nearly constant, with the mean [Na/ Mg] {\sime}
-0.5. (IV) The K/Sc, Ca/Sc, and Ti/Sc ratios form well-defined trends,
suggesting a common site of the K-Ti production. (v) Sr follows the Fe
abundance down to [Fe/H] {\sime} -2.5, while Zr is enhanced in MP stars.
(VI) The comparisons of our results with some widely used Galactic
evolution models are given. The use of the NLTE element abundances gives
increased credit to the interpretation of the data in the context of the
chemical evolution of the Galaxy.

(EMP) stars have been previously derived from high quality spectra. New
derivations, free from the NLTE effects, will better constrain the
models of the Galactic chemical evolution and the yields of the very
first supernovae. <BR /> Methods: The NLTE profiles of the magnesium and
potassium lines have been computed in a sample of 53 extremely
metal-poor stars with a modified version of the program MULTI and
adjusted to the observed lines in order to derive the abundances of
these elements. <BR /> Results: The NLTE corrections for magnesium and
potassium are in good agreement with the works found in the literature.
The abundances are slightly changed, reaching a better precision: the
scatter around the mean of the abundance ratios has decreased. Magnesium
may be used with confidence as reference element. Together with
previously determined NLTE abundances of sodium and aluminum, the new
ratios are displayed, for comparison, along the theoretical trends
proposed by some models of the chemical evolution of the Galaxy, using
different models of supernovae.

stars as a function of stellar age to provide constraints for stellar
evolutions models and to investigate whether there is a connection
between low Li abundance and the occurrence of planets. <BR /> Methods:
For a sample of 21 solar twins observed with the HARPS spectrograph at
high spectral resolution (R {\sime} 115.000) and very high
signal-to-noise ratio (600 {\le} S/N {\le} 2400), precise lithium
abundances were obtained by spectral synthesis of the Li I 6707.8
{\AA} line and compared to stellar ages, masses, and metallicities
determined from a spectroscopic analysis of the same set of HARPS
spectra. <BR /> Results: We show that for the large majority of the
solar twins there is a strong correlation between lithium abundance and
stellar age. As the age increases from 1 to 9 Gyr, the Li abundance
decreases by a factor of \~{}50. The relation agrees fairly well with
predictions from non-standard stellar evolution models of Li destruction
at the bottom of the upper convection zone. Two stars deviate from the
relation by having Li abundances enhanced by a factor of \~{}10, which may
be due to planet engulfment. On the other hand, we find no indication of
a link between planet hosting stars and enhanced lithium depletion.

	Abstract = {{The Sloan Digital Sky Survey III (SDSS-III) Apache Point Observatory
Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE) is a three-year survey that is
collecting 10$^{5}$ high-resolution spectra in the near-IR across
multiple Galactic populations. To derive stellar parameters and chemical
compositions from this massive data set, the APOGEE Stellar Parameters
and Chemical Abundances Pipeline (ASPCAP) has been developed. Here, we
describe empirical calibrations of stellar parameters presented in the
first SDSS-III APOGEE data release (DR10). These calibrations were
enabled by observations of 559 stars in 20 globular and open clusters.
The cluster observations were supplemented by observations of stars in
NASA's Kepler field that have well determined surface gravities from
asteroseismic analysis. We discuss the accuracy and precision of the
derived stellar parameters, considering especially effective
temperature, surface gravity, and metallicity; we also briefly discuss
the derived results for the abundances of the {$\alpha$}-elements, carbon,
and nitrogen. Overall, we find that ASPCAP achieves reasonably accurate
results for temperature and metallicity, but suffers from systematic
errors in surface gravity. We derive calibration relations that bring
the raw ASPCAP results into better agreement with independently
determined stellar parameters. The internal scatter of ASPCAP parameters
within clusters suggests that metallicities are measured with a
precision better than 0.1 dex, effective temperatures better than 150 K,
and surface gravities better than 0.2 dex. The understanding provided by
the clusters and Kepler giants on the current accuracy and precision
will be invaluable for future improvements of the pipeline.

	Abstract = {{Sub-subgiant stars (SSGs) lie to the red of the main sequence and
fainter than the red giant branch in cluster color-magnitude
diagrams (CMDs), a region not easily populated by standard stellar
evolution pathways. While there has been speculation on what mechanisms
may create these unusual stars, no well-developed theory exists to
explain their origins. Here we discuss three hypotheses of SSG
formation: (1) mass transfer in a binary system, (2) stripping of a
subgiant{\rsquo}s envelope, perhaps during a dynamical encounter, and (3)
reduced luminosity due to magnetic fields that lower convective
efficiency and produce large starspots. Using the stellar evolution code
MESA, we develop evolutionary tracks for each of these hypotheses, and
compare the expected stellar and orbital properties of these models with
six known SSGs in the two open clusters M67 and NGC 6791. All three of
these mechanisms can create stars or binary systems in the SSG CMD
domain. We also calculate the frequency with which each of these
mechanisms may create SSG systems, and find that the magnetic field
hypothesis is expected to create SSGs with the highest frequency in open
clusters. Mass transfer and envelope stripping have lower expected
formation frequencies, but may nevertheless create occasional SSGs in
open clusters. They may also be important mechanisms to create SSGs in
higher mass globular clusters.

signal-to-noise ratio S/N $\gt$ 100. The Na, Al, Cu, and Zn abundances
were derived in an LTE approximation; the synthetic spectrum for the
copper lines was calculated taking into account super-fine structure of
the lines. We analyzed the abundances of these elements as a function of
metallicity [Fe/H] for stars of the thin and thick disks of the Galaxy
and the Hercules moving group. The Cu abundances and their trends with
metallicity are essentially the same in the three studied
sub-structures. The mean Al and Zn abundances for stars of the thin and
thick disks differ significantly.

neighbourhood of a model Galaxy that is the endpoint of a simulation of
the chemical evolution of the Milky Way in the presence of radial mixing
of stars and gas. Although the simulation's star formation rate declines
monotonically from its unique peak and no merger or tidal event ever
takes place, the model replicates all known properties of a thick disc,
as well as matching special features of the local stellar population
such as a metal-poor extension of the thin disc that has high rotational
velocity. We divide the disc by chemistry and relate this dissection to
observationally more convenient kinematic selection criteria. We
conclude that the observed chemistry of the Galactic disc does not
provide convincing evidence for a violent origin of the thick disc, as
has been widely claimed.

	Abstract = {{Context. Gaia Data Release 1 (DR1) contains astrometric results for more
than 1 billion stars brighter than magnitude 20.7 based on observations
collected by the Gaia satellite during the first 14 months of its
operational phase. <BR /> Aims: We give a brief overview of the
astrometric content of the data release and of the model assumptions,
data processing, and validation of the results. <BR /> Methods: For
stars in common with the Hipparcos and Tycho-2 catalogues, complete
astrometric single-star solutions are obtained by incorporating
positional information from the earlier catalogues. For other stars only
their positions are obtained, essentially by neglecting their proper
motions and parallaxes. The results are validated by an analysis of the
residuals, through special validation runs, and by comparison with
external data. <BR /> Results: For about two million of the brighter
stars (down to magnitude  11.5) we obtain positions, parallaxes, and
proper motions to Hipparcos-type precision or better. For these stars,
systematic errors depending for example on position and colour are at a
level of {\plusmn} 0.3 milliarcsecond (mas). For the remaining stars we
obtain positions at epoch J2015.0 accurate to  10 mas. Positions and
proper motions are given in a reference frame that is aligned with the
International Celestial Reference Frame (ICRF) to better than 0.1 mas at
epoch J2015.0, and non-rotating with respect to ICRF to within 0.03 mas
yr$^{-1}$. The Hipparcos reference frame is found to rotate with
respect to the Gaia DR1 frame at a rate of 0.24 mas yr$^{-1}$. <BR /> Conclusions: Based on less than a quarter of the nominal mission
length and on very provisional and incomplete calibrations, the quality
and completeness of the astrometric data in Gaia DR1 are far from what
is expected for the final mission products. The present results
nevertheless represent a huge improvement in the available fundamental
stellar data and practical definition of the optical reference frame.

	Abstract = {{Isotope ratios have opened a new window into the study of the details of
stellar evolution, supernovae and galactic chemical evolution. We
present the evolution of the isotope ratios of elemental abundances
(from C to Zn) in the solar neighbourhood, bulge, halo and thick disc,
using chemical evolution models with updated yields of asymptotic giant
branch (AGB) stars and core-collapse supernovae. The evolutionary
history of each element is different owing to the effects of the initial
progenitor mass and metallicity on element production. In the bulge and
thick disc the star formation time-scale is shorter than in the solar
neighbourhood, leading to higher [{$\alpha$}/Fe] ratios. Likewise, the
smaller contribution from Type Ia supernovae in these regions leads to
lower [Mn/Fe] ratios. Also in the bulge, the abundances of [(Na, Al, P,
Cl, K, Sc, Cu, Zn)/Fe] are higher because of the effect of metallicity
on element production from core-collapse supernovae. According to our
predictions, it is possible to find metal-rich stars ([Fe/H] {\gsim}-1)
that formed in the early Universe as a result of rapid star formation.
The chemical enrichment time-scale of the halo is longer than in the
solar neighbourhood, and consequently the ratios of [(C, F)/Fe] and
$^{12}$C/$^{13}$C are higher owing to a significant
contribution from low-mass AGB stars. While the [{$\alpha$}/Fe] and [Mn/Fe]
ratios are the same as in the solar neighbourhood, the [(Na, Al, P, Cl,
K, Sc, Cu, Zn)/Fe] ratios are predicted to be lower. Furthermore, we
predict that isotope ratios such as $^{24}$Mg/$^{25, 26}$Mg
are larger because of the contribution from low-metallicity supernovae.
Using isotopic ratios, it is possible to select stars that formed in a
system with a low chemical enrichment efficiency such as the satellite
galaxies that were accreted on to our own Milky Way Galaxy.

	Abstract = {{Gaia and its complementary spectroscopic surveys combined will yield the
most comprehensive database of kinematic and chemical information of
stars in the Milky Way. The Gaia FGK benchmark stars play a central role
in this matter as they are calibration pillars for the atmospheric
parameters and chemical abundances for various surveys. The
spectroscopic analyses of the benchmark stars are done by combining
different methods, and the results will be affected by the systematic
uncertainties inherent in each method. In this paper, we explore some of
these systematic uncertainties. We determined line abundances of Ca, Cr,
Mn and Co for four benchmark stars using six different methods. We
changed the default input parameters of the different codes in a
systematic way and found, in some cases, significant differences between
the results. Since there is no consensus on the correct values for many
of these default parameters, we urge the community to raise discussions
towards standard input parameters that could alleviate the difference in
abundances obtained by different methods. In this work, we provide
quantitative estimates of uncertainties in elemental abundances due to
the effect of differing technical assumptions in spectrum modelling.

	Abstract = {{Context. Due to their volatile nature, when sulphur and zinc are
observed in external galaxies, their determined abundances represent the
gas-phase abundances in the interstellar medium. This implies that they
can be used as tracers of the chemical enrichment of matter in the
Universe at high redshift. Comparable observations in stars are more
difficult and, until recently, plagued by small number statistics. <BR
/> Aims: We wish to exploit the Gaia-ESO Survey (GES) data to study the
behaviour of sulphur and zinc abundances of a large number of Galactic
stars, in a homogeneous way. <BR /> Methods: By using the UVES spectra
of the GES sample, we are able to assemble a sample of 1301 Galactic
stars, including stars in open and globular clusters in which both
sulphur and zinc were measured. <BR /> Results: We confirm the results
from the literature that sulphur behaves as an {$\alpha$}-element. We find
a large scatter in [Zn/Fe] ratios among giant stars around solar
metallicity. The lower ratios are observed in giant stars at
Galactocentric distances less than 7.5 kpc. No such effect is observed
among dwarf stars, since they do not extend to that radius. <BR />
Conclusions: Given the sample selection, giants and dwarfs are observed
at different Galactic locations, and it is plausible, and compatible
with simple calculations, that Zn-poor giants trace a younger population
more polluted by SN Ia yields. It is necessary to extend observations in
order to observe both giants and dwarfs at the same Galactic location.
Further theoretical work on the evolution of zinc is also necessary.

	Abstract = {{We present a uniform study of the chemical abundances of 12 elements
(Si, Ca, Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Co, Ni, Na, Mg, and Al) derived from the
spectra of 451 stars observed as part of one of the HARPS GTO planet
search programs. Sixty eight of these are planet-bearing stars. The main
goals of our work are: i) the investigation of possible differences
between the abundances of stars with and without planets; ii) the study
of the possible differences in the abundances of stars in the thin and
the thick disc. We confirm that there is a systematically higher
metallicity in planet host stars, when compared to non planet-hosts,
common to all studied species. We also found that there is no difference
in the galactic chemical evolution trends of the stars with and without
planets. Stars that harbour planetary companions simply appear to be in
the high metallicity tail of the distribution. We also confirm that
Neptunian and super-Earth class planets may be easier to find at lower
metallicities. A statistically significative abundance difference
between stars of the thin and the thick disc was found for [ Fe/H] $\lt$
0. However, the populations from the thick and the thin disc cannot be
clearly separated.

	Abstract = {{We present a new basis for scaling abundances with total metallicity in
nebular photoionization models, based on extensive Milky Way stellar
abundance data, to replace the uniform scaling normally used in the
analysis of H II regions. Our goal is to provide a single scaling method
and local abundance reference standard for use in nebular modelling and
its key inputs, the stellar atmosphere and evolutionary track models. We
introduce a parametric enrichment factor, {$\zeta$}, to describe how atomic
abundances scale with total abundance, which allows for a simple
conversion between scales based on different reference elements (usually
oxygen or iron). The models and parametric description provide a more
physically realistic approach than simple uniform abundance scaling.
With appropriate parameters, the methods described here may be applied
to H II regions in the Milky Way, large and dwarf galaxies in the local
Universe, active galactic nuclei, and to star-forming regions at high
redshift.

systematic errors inherent in classical determinations of the oxygen
abundance that arise from the use of one-dimensional (1D) hydrostatic
model atmospheres and from the assumption of local thermodynamic
equilibrium (LTE). We perform detailed 3D non-LTE radiative-transfer
calculations for atomic oxygen lines across a grid of 3D hydrodynamic
STAGGER model atmospheres for dwarfs and subgiants. We apply our grid of
predicted line strengths of the [O I] 630 nm and O I 777 nm lines using
accurate stellar parameters from the literature. We infer a steep decay
in [O/Fe] for [Fe/H] {\gsim} -1.0, a plateau [O/Fe] {\ap} 0.5 down to
[Fe/H] {\ap} -2.5, and an increasing trend for [Fe/H] {\lsim} -2.5. Our 3D
non-LTE calculations yield overall concordant results from the two
oxygen abundance diagnostics.

@article{Hawkins2016b,
	Abstract = {{Context. The APOGEE survey has obtained high-resolution infrared spectra
of more than 100 000 stars. Deriving chemical abundances patterns of
these stars is paramount to piecing together the structure of the Milky
Way. While the derived chemical abundances have been shown to be precise
for most stars, some calibration problems have been reported, in
particular for more metal-poor stars. <BR /> Aims: In this paper, we aim
to (1) re-determine the chemical abundances of the APOGEE+Kepler stellar
sample (APOKASC) with an independent procedure, line list and line
selection, and high-quality surface gravity information from
asteroseismology; and (2) extend the abundance catalogue by including
abundances that are not currently reported in the most recent APOGEE
release (DR12). <BR /> Methods: We fixed the T$_{eff}$ and log g
to those determined using spectrophotometric and asteroseismic
techniques, respectively. We made use of the Brussels Automatic Stellar
Parameter (BACCHUS) code to derive the metallicity and broadening
parameters for the APOKASC sample. In addition, we derived differential
abundances with respect to Arcturus. <BR /> Results: We have validated
the BACCHUS code on APOGEE data using several well-known stars, and
stars from open and globular clusters. We also provide the abundances of
C, N, O, Mg, Ca, Si, Ti, S, Al, Na, Ni, Mn, Fe, K, and V for every star
and line, and show the impact of line selection on the final abundances.
Improvements have been made for some elements (e.g. Ti, Si, V).
Additionally, we measure new abundance ratios not found in the current
APOGEE release including P, Cu, Rb, and Yb, which are only upper limits
at this time, as well as Co and Cr which are promising. <BR />
Conclusions: In this paper, we present an independent analysis of the
APOKASC sample and provide abundances of up to 21 elements. This
catalogue can be used not only to study chemical abundance patterns of
the Galaxy but also to train data driven spectral approaches which can
improve the abundance precision in a restricted dataset, but also full
APOGEE sample.

	Abstract = {{The fourth generation of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS-IV) began
observations in 2014 July. It pursues three core programs: the Apache
Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment 2 (APOGEE-2), Mapping
Nearby Galaxies at APO (MaNGA), and the Extended Baryon Oscillation
Spectroscopic Survey (eBOSS). As well as its core program, eBOSS
contains two major subprograms: the Time Domain Spectroscopic Survey
(TDSS) and the SPectroscopic IDentification of ERosita Sources
(SPIDERS). This paper describes the first data release from SDSS-IV,
Data Release 13 (DR13). DR13 makes publicly available the first 1390
spatially resolved integral field unit observations of nearby galaxies
from MaNGA. It includes new observations from eBOSS, completing the
Sloan Extended QUasar, Emission-line galaxy, Luminous red galaxy Survey
(SEQUELS), which also targeted variability-selected objects and
X-ray-selected objects. DR13 includes new reductions of the SDSS-III
BOSS data, improving the spectrophotometric calibration and redshift
classification, and new reductions of the SDSS-III APOGEE-1 data,
improving stellar parameters for dwarf stars and cooler stars. DR13
provides more robust and precise photometric calibrations. Value-added
target catalogs relevant for eBOSS, TDSS, and SPIDERS and an updated
red-clump catalog for APOGEE are also available. This paper describes
the location and format of the data and provides references to important
technical papers. The SDSS web site, <A
href=``http://www.sdss.org''>http://www.sdss.org</A>, provides links to
the data, tutorials, examples of data access, and extensive
documentation of the reduction and analysis procedures. DR13 is the
first of a scheduled set that will contain new data and analyses from
the planned {\sim}6 yr operations of SDSS-IV.

	Abstract = {{To understand the formation and evolution of solar-type stars and
planets in the solar neighborhood, we need to obtain their stellar
parameters with high precision. We present a catalog of precise stellar
parameters for low-activity FGK single stars in a volume-limited sample
followed by the HARPS spectrograph in the quest to identify extra-solar
planets. The spectroscopic analysis was completed assuming LTE with a
grid of Kurucz atmosphere models and using the ARES code to perform an
automatic measurement of the line equivalent widths. The results are
compared with different independent methods and also with other values
found in the literature for common stars. Both comparisons are
consistent and illustrate the homogeneity of the parameters derived by
our team. The derived metallicities of this sample reveal a somewhat
different distribution for the present planet hosts, but still indicates
the already known higher frequency of planets observed for the more
metal-rich stars. We combine the results derived in this sample with the
one from the CORALIE survey to present the largest homogeneous
spectroscopic study of the metallicity-giant-planet relation using a
total of 1830 stars.

	Abstract = {{We present a re-analysis of the Geneva-Copenhagen survey, which benefits
from the infrared flux method to improve the accuracy of the derived
stellar effective temperatures and uses the latter to build a consistent
and improved metallicity scale. Metallicities are calibrated on
high-resolution spectroscopy and checked against four open clusters and
a moving group, showing excellent consistency. The new temperature and
metallicity scales provide a better match to theoretical isochrones,
which are used for a Bayesian analysis of stellar ages. With respect to
previous analyses, our stars are on average 100 K hotter and 0.1 dex
more metal rich, which shift the peak of the metallicity distribution
function around the solar value. From Str{\"o}mgren photometry we are
able to derive for the first time a proxy for [{$\alpha$}/Fe] abundances,
which enables us to perform a tentative dissection of the chemical thin
and thick disc. We find evidence for the latter being composed of an
old, mildly but systematically alpha-enhanced population that extends to
super solar metallicities, in agreement with spectroscopic studies. Our
revision offers the largest existing kinematically unbiased sample of
the solar neighbourhood that contains full information on kinematics,
metallicities, and ages and thus provides better constraints on the
physical processes relevant in the build-up of the Milky Way disc,
enabling a better understanding of the Sun in a Galactic context.

Pole, allowing the stellar luminosity function in absolute visual
magnitude, bolometric magnitude, and mass in the solar neighborhood for
all absolute magnitudes above the thermonuclear burning limit, to be
derived. Also obtained are the density laws with distance from the
Galactic plane for each absolute magnitude. The 300 pc scale height
component is identified as an old disk, and the 1350 pc scale height
component as a Galactic 'thick disk'. The luminosity function and
density law of the thick disk are consistent with a substantial
flattening of the spheroid isodensity contours by the gravitational
potential of the Galactic disk, in agreement with recent observations of

@article{Martig2013,
	Abstract = {{We study seven simulated disc galaxies, three with a quiescent merger
history, and four with mergers in their last 9 Gyr of evolution. We
compare their structure at z = 0 by decomposing them into `mono-age
populations' (MAPs) of stars within 500 Myr age bins. All studied
galaxies undergo a phase of merging activity at high redshift, so that
stars older than 9 Gyr are found in a centrally concentrated component,
while younger stars are mostly found in discs. We find that most MAPs
have simple exponential radial and vertical density profiles, with a
scaleheight that typically increases with age. Because a large range of
merger histories can create populations with simple structures, this
suggests that the simplicity of the structure of mono-abundance
populations observed in the Milky Way by Bovy et al. is not necessarily
a direct indicator of a quiescent history for the Milky Way. Similarly,
the anticorrelation between scalelength and scaleheight does not
necessarily imply a merger-free history. However, mergers produce
discontinuities between thin and thick disc components, and jumps in the
age-velocity relation. The absence of a structural discontinuity between
thin and thick disc observed in the Milky Way would seem to be a good
indicator that no merger with a mass ratio larger than 1:15-1:10
occurred in the last 9 Gyr. Mergers at higher redshift might
nevertheless be necessary to produce the thickest, hottest components of
the Milky Way's disc.

@article{Navarro2011,
	Abstract = {{We search for chemically distinct stellar components in the solar
neighbourhood using a compilation of published data. Extending earlier
work, we show that when the abundances of Fe, {$\alpha$} elements and the
r-process element Eu are considered together, stars separate neatly into
two groups that delineate the traditional thin and thick disc components
of the Milky Way. The group akin to the thin disc is traced by stars
with [Fe/H] $\gt$ -0.7 and [{$\alpha$}/Fe] $\lt$ 0.2. The thick disc-like
group overlaps the thin disc in [Fe/H] but has higher abundances of
{$\alpha$} elements and Eu. Stars in the range -1.5 $\lt$ [Fe/H] $\lt$ -0.7
with low [{$\alpha$}/Fe] ratios, however, seem to belong to a separate,
dynamically cold, non-rotating component that we associate with tidal
debris. The kinematically hot stellar halo dominates the sample for
[Fe/H] $\lt$ -1.5. These results suggest that it may be possible to
define the main dynamical components of the solar neighbourhood using
only their chemistry, an approach with a number of interesting
consequences. With such definition, the kinematics of thin disc stars is
found to be independent of metallicity: their average rotation speed
remains roughly constant in the range -0.7 $\lt$ [Fe/H] $\lt$ +0.4, a
result that argues against radial migration having played a substantial
role in the evolution of the thin disc. The velocity dispersion of the
thin disc is also independent of [Fe/H], implying that the familiar
increase in velocity dispersion with decreasing metallicity is the
result of the increasing prevalence of the thick disc at lower
metallicities, rather than of the sustained operation of a dynamical
heating mechanism. The substantial overlap in [Fe/H] and, likely,
stellar age, of the various components might affect other reported
trends in the properties of stars in the solar neighbourhood. A purely
chemical characterization of these components would enable us to
scrutinize these trends critically in order to understand which result
from accretion events and which result from secular changes in the
properties of the Galaxy.

probability for a star to belong to the thin disc, the thick disc or the
halo. With a probability P$\gt$= 70 per cent taken as certain membership,
we assigned 95 stars to the thick disc, 13 to the thin disc, and 20 to
the halo. The remaining 48 stars in the sample cannot be assigned with
reasonable certainty to one of the three components.

Abundances of C, O, Na, Mg, Al, Si, Ca, Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni,
Cu, Zn, Y, Ba, Ce, Nd and Eu have been obtained. The abundances for the
thick-disc stars are compared with those for the thin-disc members from
Reddy et al. The ratios of {$\alpha$}-elements (O, Mg, Si, Ca and Ti) to
iron for thick-disc stars show a clear enhancement compared to thin-disc
members in the range -0.3 $\lt$ [Fe/H] $\lt$ -1.2. There are also other
elements - Al, Sc, V, Co, and possibly Zn - which show enhanced ratios
to iron in the thick disc relative to the thin disc. The abundances of
Na, Cr, Mn, Ni and Cu (relative to Fe) are very similar for thin- and
thick-disc stars. The dispersion in abundance ratios [X/Fe] at given
[Fe/H] for thick-disc stars is consistent with the expected scatter due
to measurement errors, suggesting a lack of `cosmic' scatter.

A few stars classified as members of the thick disc by our kinematic
criteria show thin-disc abundances. These stars, which appear older than
most thin-disc stars, are also, on average, younger than the thick-disc
population. They may have originated early in the thin-disc history, and
been subsequently scattered to hotter orbits by collisions. The thick
disc may not include stars with [Fe/H] $\gt$ -0.3. The observed
compositions of the thin and thick discs seem to be consistent with the
models of galaxy formation by hierarchical clustering in a Lambda cold
dark matter ({$\Lambda$}CDM) universe.

	Abstract = {{Stars with planets at intermediate metallicities ([-0.7, -0.2] dex)
exhibit properties that differ from the general field stars. Thirteen
stars with planets reported in this metallicity range belong to the
thick disc, while only one planet have been detected among stars of the
thin disc. Although this statistics is weak, it contradicts the known
correlation between the presence of planet and metallicity. We relate
this finding to the specific property of the thin disc in this
metallicity range, where stars are shown to rotate around the Galaxy
faster than the Sun. Their orbital parameters are conveniently explained
if they are contaminants coming from the outer Galactic disc, as a
result of radial mixing. This must be considered together with the fact
that metal-rich stars ([Fe/H]$\gt$+0.1 dex) found in the solar
neighbourhood, which are the hosts of most of the detected planets, are
suspected of being wanderers from the inner Galactic disc. It is then
questionned why stars that originate in the inner and outer thin disc
show respectively the highest and lowest rate of detected planets. It is
suggested that the presence of giant planets might be primarily a
function of a parameter linked to galactocentric radius, but not
metallicity. Combined with the existing radial metallicity gradient,
then radial mixing explains the correlation at high metallicity observed
locally, but also the peculiarity found at low metallicity, which cannot
be accounted for by a simple correlation between metallicity and planet
probability.

	Abstract = {{From a detailed elemental abundance analysis of 102 F and G dwarf stars
we present abundance trends in the Galactic thin and thick disks for 14
elements (O, Na, Mg, Al, Si, Ca, Ti, Cr, Fe, Ni, Zn, Y, Ba, and Eu).
Stellar parameters and elemental abundances (except for Y, Ba and Eu)
for 66 of the 102 stars were presented in our previous studies (Bensby
et al. [CITE], A{\amp}A, 410, 527, [CITE], A{\amp}A, 415, 155). The 36
stars that are new in this study extend and confirm our previous results
and allow us to draw further conclusions regarding abundance trends. The
s-process elements Y and Ba, and the r-element Eu have also been
considered here for the whole sample for the first time. With this new
larger sample we now have the following results: 1) smooth and distinct
abundance trends that for the thin and thick disks are clearly
separated; 2) the {$\alpha$}-element trends for the thick disk show typical
signatures from the enrichment of SN Ia; 3) the thick disk stellar
sample is in the mean older than the thin disk stellar sample; 4) the
thick disk abundance trends are invariant with galactocentric radii
(R\_m); 5) the thick disk abundance trends appear to be invariant with
vertical distance (Z\_max) from the Galactic plane. Adding further
evidence from the literaure we argue that a merger/interacting scenario
with a companion galaxy to produce a kinematical heating of the stars
(that make up today's thick disk) in a pre-existing old thin disk is the
most likely formation scenario for the Galactic thick disk. The 102
stars have -1 {\lsim} [Fe/H] {\lsim} +0.4 and are all in the solar
neighbourhood. Based on their kinematics they have been divided into a
thin disk sample and a thick disk sample consisting of 60 and 38 stars,
respectively. The remaining 4 stars have kinematics that make them
kinematically intermediate to the two disks. Their chemical abundances
also place them in between the two disks. Which of the two disk
populations these 4 stars belong to, or if they form a distinct
population of their own, can at the moment not be settled. The 66 stars
from our previous studies were observed with the FEROS spectrograph on
the ESO 1.5-m telescope and the CES spectrograph on the ESO 3.6-m
telescope. Of the 36 new stars presented here 30 were observed with the
SOFIN spectrograph on the Nordic Optical Telescope on La Palma, 3 with
the UVES spectrograph on VLT/UT2, and 3 with the FEROS spectrograph on
the ESO 1.5-m telescope. All spectra have high signal-to-noise ratios
(typically S/N{\gsim} 250) and high resolution (R{\tilde} 80 000, 45 000,
and 110 000 for the SOFIN, FEROS, and UVES spectra, respectively).

	Abstract = {{Based on spectra from F and G dwarf stars, we present elemental
abundance trends in the Galactic thin and thick disks in the metallicity
regime -0.8$\lt${\tilde} [Fe/H] $\lt${\tilde} +0.4. Our findings can be
summarized as follows. 1) Both the thin and the thick disks show smooth
and distinct abundance trends that, at sub-solar metallicities, are
clearly separated. 2) For the alpha -elements the thick disk shows
signatures of chemical enrichment from SNe type Ia. 3) The age of the
thick disk sample is in the mean older than the thin disk sample. 4)
Kinematically, there exist thick disk stars with super-solar
metallicities. Based on these findings, together with other constraints
from the literature, we discuss different formation scenarios for the
thick disk. We suggest that the currently most likely formation scenario
is a violent merger event or a close encounter with a companion galaxy.
Based on kinematics the stellar sample was selected to contain stars
with high probabilities of belonging either to the thin or to the thick
Galactic disk. The total number of stars are 66 of which 21 belong to
the thick disk and 45 to the thin disk. The analysis is based on
high-resolution spectra with high signal-to-noise (R \~{}  48 000 and S/N
gtrsim  150, respectively) recorded with the FEROS spectrograph on La
Silla, Chile. Abundances have been determined for four alpha -elements
(Mg, Si, Ca, and Ti), for four even-nuclei iron peak elements (Cr, Fe,
Ni, and Zn), and for the light elements Na and Al, from equivalent width
measurements of  \~{} 30 000 spectral lines. An extensive investigation of
the atomic parameters, log  gf-values in particular, have been performed
in order to achieve abundances that are trustworthy. Noteworthy is that
we find for Ti good agreement between the abundances from Ti I and Ti
Ii. Our solar Ti abundances are in concordance with the standard
meteoritic Ti abundance

	Abstract = {{We performed a uniform and detailed analysis of 1112 high-resolution
spectra of FGK dwarfs obtained with the HARPS spectrograph at the ESO
3.6 m telescope (La Silla, Chile). Most stars have effective
temperatures 4700 K {\le} T$_{eff}$ {\le} 6300 K and lie in the
metallicity range of -1.39 {\le} [Fe/H] {\le} 0.55. Our main goal is to
investigate whether there are any differences between the elemental
abundance trends (especially [{$\alpha$}/Fe] ratio) for stars of different
subpopulations. The equivalent widths of spectral lines are
automatically measured from HARPS spectra with the ARES code. The
abundances of three {$\alpha$} elements are determined using a differential
LTE analysis relative to the Sun, with the 2010 revised version of the
spectral synthesis code MOOG and a grid of Kurucz ATLAS9 atmospheres.
The stars of our sample fall into two populations, clearly separated in
terms of [{$\alpha$}/Fe] up to super-solar metallicities. In turn,
high-{$\alpha$} stars are also separated into two families with a gap in
both [{$\alpha$}/Fe] ([{$\alpha$}/Fe] {\ap} 0.17) and metallicity ([Fe/H] {\ap}
-0.2) distributions. The metal-poor high-{$\alpha$} stars (thick disk) and
metal-rich high-{$\alpha$} stars are on average older than chemically
defined thin disk stars (low-{$\alpha$} stars). The two {$\alpha$}-enhanced
families have different kinematics and orbital parameters. The
metal-rich {$\alpha$}-enhanced stars, such as thin disk stars have nearly
circular orbits, close to the Galactic plane. We put forward the idea
that these stars may have been formed in the inner Galactic disk, but
their exact nature still remains to be clarified.

	Abstract = {{We present a chemical abundance distribution study in 14 {$\alpha$}, odd-Z,
even-Z, light, and Fe-peak elements of approximately 3200
intermediate-metallicity giant stars from the Apache Point Observatory
Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE) survey. The main aim of our
analysis is to explore the Galactic disc-halo transition region within
-1.20 $\lt$ [Fe/H] $\lt$ -0.55 as a means to study chemical difference
(and similarities) between these components. In this paper, we show that
there is an {$\alpha$}-poor and {$\alpha$}-rich sequence within both the
metal-poor and intermediate-metallicity regions. Using the Galactic
rest-frame radial velocity and spatial positions, we further separate
our sample into the canonical Galactic components. We then studied the
abundances ratios of Mg, Ti, Si, Ca, O, S, Al, C+N, Na, Ni, Mn, V, and K
for each of the components and found the following: (1) the {$\alpha$}-poor
halo subgroup is chemically distinct in the {$\alpha$}-elements,
particularly O, Mg, S, Al, C+N, and Ni, from the {$\alpha$}-rich halo,
consistent with the literature confirming the existence of an
{$\alpha$}-poor accreted halo population; (2) the canonical thick disc and
halo are not chemically distinct in all elements indicating a smooth
transition between the thick disc and halo; (3) a subsample of the
{$\alpha$}-poor stars at metallicities as low as [Fe/H] {\tilde} -0.85 dex
are chemically and dynamically consistent with the thin disc indicating
that the thin disc may extend to lower metallicities than previously
thought; and (4) the locations of the most metal-poor thin disc stars
are consistent with a negative radial metallicity gradient. Finally, we
used our analysis to suggest a new set of chemical abundance planes
([{$\alpha$}/Fe], [C+N/Fe], [Al/Fe], and [Mg/Mn]) that may be able to
chemically label the Galactic components in a clean and efficient way
independent of kinematics.

	Abstract = {{The heaviest iron-peak element, Zn has been used as an important tracer
of cosmic chemical evolution. Spectroscopic observations of the
metal-poor stars in Local Group galaxies show that an increasing trend
of [Zn/Fe] ratios toward lower metallicity. However, enrichment of Zn in
galaxies is not well understood due to the poor knowledge of
astrophysical sites of Zn as well as metal mixing in galaxies. Here we
show possible explanations for the observed trend by taking into account
electron-capture supernovae (ECSNe) as one of the sources of Zn in our
chemodynamical simulations of dwarf galaxies. We find that the ejecta
from ECSNe contribute to stars with [Zn/Fe] $\gtrsim$ 0.5. We also find
that scatters of [Zn/Fe] in higher metallicity originate from the ejecta
of type Ia supernovae. On the other hand, it appears difficult to
explain the observed trends if we do not consider ECSNe as a source of
Zn. These results come from inhomogeneous spatial metallicity
distribution due to the inefficiency of metal mixing. We find that the
optimal value of scaling factor for metal diffusion coefficient is
$\sim$ 0.01 in the shear-based metal mixing model in smoothed particle
hydrodynamics simulations. These results suggest that ECSNe can be one
of the contributors to the enrichment of Zn in galaxies.

	Abstract = {{We derive atmospheric parameters and lithium abundances for 671 stars
and include our measurements in a literature compilation of 1381 dwarf
and subgiant stars. First, a ``lithium desert'' in the effective
temperature (T $_{eff}$) versus lithium abundance (A
$_{Li}$) plane is observed such that no stars with T
$_{eff}$ \~{}= 6075 K and A $_{Li}$ \~{}= 1.8 are found. We
speculate that most of the stars on the low A $_{Li}$ side of the
desert have experienced a short-lived period of severe surface lithium
destruction as main-sequence or subgiant stars. Next, we search for
differences in the lithium content of thin-disk and thick-disk stars,
but we find that internal processes have erased from the stellar
photospheres their possibly different histories of lithium enrichment.
Nevertheless, we note that the maximum lithium abundance of thick-disk
stars is nearly constant from [Fe/H] = -1.0 to -0.1, at a value that is
similar to that measured in very metal-poor halo stars (A $_{Li}$
\~{}= 2.2). Finally, differences in the lithium abundance distribution of
known planet-host stars relative to otherwise ordinary stars appear when
restricting the samples to narrow ranges of T $_{eff}$ or mass,
but they are fully explained by age and metallicity biases. We confirm
the lack of a connection between low lithium abundance and planets.
However, we find that no low A $_{Li}$ planet-hosts are found in
the desert T $_{eff}$ window. Provided that subtle sample biases
are not responsible for this observation, this suggests that the
presence of gas giant planets inhibit the mechanism responsible for the
lithium desert.

	Abstract = {{Lithium abundance in most of the warm metal-poor main sequence stars
shows a constant plateau (A(Li)\~{}2.2 dex) and then the upper envelope of
the lithium vs. metallicity distribution increases as we approach solar
metallicity. Meteorites, which carry information about the chemical
composition of the interstellar medium at the solar system formation
time, show a lithium abundance A(Li)\~{}3.26 dex. This pattern reflects the
Li enrichment history of the interstellar medium during the Galaxy
lifetime. After the initial Li production in Big Bang Nucleosynthesis,
the sources of the enrichment include AGB stars, low-mass red giants,
novae, type II supernovae, and Galactic cosmic rays. The total amount of
enriched Li is sensitive to the relative contribution of these sources.
Thus different Li enrichment histories are expected in the Galactic
thick and thin disc. We investigate the main sequence stars observed
with UVES in Gaia-ESO Survey iDR4 catalog and find a Li-[alpha/Fe]
anticorrelation independent of [Fe/H], Teff, and log(g). Since in
stellar evolution different $\{$$\backslash$alpha$\}$ enhancements at the same
metallicity do not lead to a measurable Li abundance change, the
anticorrelation indicates that more Li is produced during the Galactic
thin disc phase than during the Galactic thick disc phase. We also find
a correlation between the abundance of Li and s-process elements Ba and
Y, and they both decrease above the solar metallicity, which can be
explained in the framework of the adopted Galactic chemical evolution
models.

	Abstract = {{Context. Recent observations suggest a double-branch behaviour of Li/H
versus metallicity in the local thick and thin discs. This is
reminiscent of the corresponding O/Fe versus Fe/H behaviour, which has
been explained as resulting from radial migration in the Milky Way disc.
<BR /> Aims: We study here the role of radial migration in shaping these
observations. <BR /> Methods: We use a semi-analytical model of disc
evolution with updated chemical yields and parameterised radial
migration. We explore the cases of long-lived (red giants of a few Gy
lifetime) and shorter-lived (asymptotic giant branch stars of several
10$^{8}$ yr) stellar sources of Li, as well as those of low and
high primordial Li. We show that both factors play a key role in the
overall Li evolution. <BR /> Results: We find that the observed
two-branch Li behaviour is only directly obtained in the case of
long-lived stellar Li sources and low primordial Li. In all other cases,
the data imply systematic Li depletion in stellar envelopes, thus no
simple picture of the Li evolution can be obtained. This concerns also
the reported Li/H decrease at supersolar metallicities.

	Abstract = {{We present sodium abundances for a sample of nearby stars. All results
have been derived from NLTE statistical equilibrium calculations. The
influence of collisional interactions with electrons and hydrogen atoms
is evaluated by comparison of the solar spectrum with very precise fits
to the Na I line cores. The NLTE effects are more pronounced in
metal-poor stars since the statistical equilibrium is dominated by
collisions of which at least the electronic component is substantially
reduced. The resulting influence on the determination of sodium
abundances is in a direction opposite to that found previously for Mg
and Al. The NLTE corrections are about -0.1 in thick-disk stars with
[Fe/H] {\tilde}-0.6. Our [Na/Fe] abundance ratios are about solar for
thick- and thin-disk stars. The increase in [Na/Fe] as a function of
[Fe/H] for metal-rich stars found by Edvardsson et al. ($\backslash$cite$\{$EAG93$\}$) is
confirmed. Our results suggest that sodium yields increase with the
metallicity, and quite large amounts of sodium may be produced by AGB
stars. We find that [Na/Fe] ratios, together with either [Mg/Fe] ratio,
kinematic data or stellar evolutionary ages, make possible the
individual discrimination between thin- and thick-disk membership.

	Abstract = {{Neutral sodium is a minority species in the atmospheres of late-type

often a poor assumption, in particular for strong lines. We present an
extensive grid of non-LTE calculations for several Na I lines in cool
stellar atmospheres, including metal-rich and metal-poor dwarfs and
giants. For the first time, we constructed a Na model atom that
incorporates accurate quantum mechanical calculations for collisional
excitation and ionisation by electrons as well as collisional excitation
and charge exchange reactions with neutral hydrogen. Similar to Li I,
the new rates for hydrogen impact excitation do not affect the
statistical equilibrium calculations, while charge exchange reactions
have a small but non-negligible influence. The presented LTE and non-LTE
curves-of-growth can be interpolated to obtain non-LTE abundances and
abundance corrections for arbitrary stellar parameter combinations and
line strengths. The typical corrections for weak lines are -0.1... -0.2
dex, whereas saturated lines may overestimate the abundance in LTE by
more than 0.5 dex. The non-LTE Na abundances appear very robust with

@article{Osorio2015,
	Abstract = {{Context. Magnesium is an element of significant astrophysical
importance, often traced in late-type stars using lines of neutral
magnesium, which is expected to be subject to departures from local
thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE). The importance of Mg , together with
the unique range of spectral features in late-type stars probing
different parts of the atom, as well as its relative simplicity from an
atomic physics point of view, makes it a prime target and test bed for
detailed ab initio non-LTE modelling in stellar atmospheres. Previous
non-LTE modelling of spectral line formation has, however, been subject
to uncertainties due to lack of accurate data for inelastic collisions
with electrons and hydrogen atoms. <BR /> Aims: In this paper we build
and test a Mg model atom for spectral line formation in late-type stars
with new or recent inelastic collision data and no associated free
parameters. We aim to reduce these uncertainties and thereby improve the
accuracy of Mg non-LTE modelling in late-type stars. <BR /> Methods: For
the low-lying states of Mg i, electron collision data were calculated
using the R-matrix method. Hydrogen collision data, including charge
transfer processes, were taken from recent calculations by some of us.
Calculations for collisional broadening by neutral hydrogen were also
performed where data were missing. These calculations, together with
data from the literature, were used to build a model atom. This model
was then employed in the context of standard non-LTE modelling in 1D
(including average 3D) model atmospheres in a small set of stellar
atmosphere models. First, the modelling was tested by comparisons with
observed spectra of benchmark stars with well-known parameters. Second,
the spectral line behaviour and uncertainties were explored by extensive
experiments in which sets of collisional data were changed or removed.
<BR /> Results: The modelled spectra agree well with observed spectra
from benchmark stars, showing much better agreement with line profile
shapes than with LTE modelling. The line-to-line scatter in the derived
abundances shows some improvements compared to LTE (where the cores of
strong lines must often be ignored), particularly when coupled with
averaged 3D models. The observed Mg emission features at 7 and 12 {$\mu$}m
in the spectra of the Sun and Arcturus, which are sensitive to the
collision data, are reasonably well reproduced. Charge transfer with H
is generally important as a thermalising mechanism in dwarfs, but less
so in giants. Excitation due to collisions with H is found to be quite
important in both giants and dwarfs. The R-matrix calculations for
electron collisions also lead to significant differences compared to
when approximate formulas are employed. The modelling predicts non-LTE
abundance corrections {$\Delta$}A(Mg )$_{<SUB>NLTE-LTE}$</SUB> in
dwarfs, both solar metallicity and metal-poor, to be very small (of
order 0.01 dex), even smaller than found in previous studies. In giants,
corrections vary greatly between lines, but can be as large as 0.4 dex.
<BR /> Conclusions: Our results emphasise the need for accurate data of
Mg collisions with both electrons and H atoms for precise non-LTE
predictions of stellar spectra, but demonstrate that such data can be
calculated and that ab initio non-LTE modelling without resort to free
parameters is possible. In contrast to Li and Na, where only the
introduction of charge transfer processes has led to differences with
respect to earlier non-LTE modelling, the more complex case of Mg finds
changes due to improvements in the data for collisional excitation by
electrons and hydrogen atoms, as well as due to the charge transfer
processes. Grids of departure coefficients and abundance corrections for
a range of stellar parameters are planned for a forthcoming paper.

	Abstract = {{The stellar disc of the Milky Way shows complex spatial and abundance
structure that is central to understanding the key physical mechanisms
responsible for shaping our Galaxy. In this study, we use six very high
resolution cosmological zoom-in simulations of Milky Way-sized haloes to
study the prevalence and formation of chemically distinct disc
components. We find that our simulations develop a clearly bimodal
distribution in the [{$\alpha$}/Fe]-[Fe/H] plane. We find two main pathways
to creating this dichotomy, which operate in different regions of the
galaxies: (a) an early (z $\gt$ 1) and intense high-[{$\alpha$}/Fe] star
formation phase in the inner region (R {\lsim} 5 kpc) induced by gas-rich
mergers, followed by more quiescent low-[{$\alpha$}/Fe] star formation; and
(b) an early phase of high-[{$\alpha$}/Fe] star formation in the outer disc
followed by a shrinking of the gas disc owing to a temporarily lowered
gas accretion rate, after which disc growth resumes. In process (b), a
double-peaked star formation history around the time and radius of disc
shrinking accentuates the dichotomy. If the early star formation phase
is prolonged (rather than short and intense), chemical evolution
proceeds as per process (a) in the inner region, but the dichotomy is
less clear. In the outer region, the dichotomy is only evident if the
first intense phase of star formation covers a large enough radial range
before disc shrinking occurs; otherwise, the outer disc consists of only
low-[{$\alpha$}/Fe] sequence stars. We discuss the implication that both
processes occurred in the Milky Way.

	Abstract = {{<BR /> Aims: Aluminium plays a key role in studies of the chemical
enrichment of the Galaxy and of globular clusters. However, strong
deviations from LTE (non-LTE) are known to significantly affect the
inferred abundances in giant and metal-poor stars. <BR /> Methods: We
present non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (NLTE) modeling of aluminium
using recent and accurate atomic data, in particular utilizing new
transition rates for collisions with hydrogen atoms, without the need
for any astrophysically calibrated parameters. For the first time, we
perform 3D NLTE modeling of aluminium lines in the solar spectrum. We
also compute and make available extensive grids of abundance corrections
for lines in the optical and near-infrared using one-dimensional model
atmospheres, and apply grids of precomputed departure coefficients to
direct line synthesis for a set of benchmark stars with accurately known
stellar parameters. <BR /> Results: Our 3D NLTE modeling of the solar
spectrum reproduces observed center-to-limb variations in the solar
spectrum of the 7835 {\AA} line as well as the mid-infrared
photospheric emission line at 12.33 {$\mu$}m. We infer a 3D NLTE solar
photospheric abundance of A(Al) = 6.43 {\plusmn} 0.03, in exact agreement
with the meteoritic abundance. We find that abundance corrections vary
rapidly with stellar parameters; for the 3961 {\AA} resonance line,
corrections are positive and may be as large as +1 dex, while
corrections for subordinate lines generally have positive sign for warm
stars but negative for cool stars. Our modeling reproduces the observed
line profiles of benchmark K-giants, and we find abundance corrections
as large as -0.3 dex for Arcturus. Our analyses of four metal-poor
benchmark stars yield consistent abundances between the 3961 {\AA}
resonance line and lines in the UV, optical and near-infrared regions.
Finally, we discuss implications for the galactic chemical evolution of
aluminium.

	Abstract = {{As one of the most important elements in astronomy, iron abundance
determinations need to be as accurate as possible. We investigate the
accuracy of spectroscopic iron abundance analyses using archetypal
metal-poor stars. We perform detailed 3D non-LTE radiative transfer
calculations based on 3D hydrodynamic STAGGER model atmospheres, and
employ a new model atom that includes new quantum-mechanical neutral
hydrogen collisional rate coefficients. With the exception of the red
giant HD122563, we find that the 3D non-LTE models achieve Fe I/Fe II
excitation and ionization balance as well as not having any trends with
equivalent width to within modelling uncertainties of 0.05 dex, all
without having to invoke any microturbulent broadening; for HD122563 we
predict that the current best parallax-based surface gravity is
overestimated by 0.5 dex. Using a 3D non-LTE analysis, we infer iron
abundances from the 3D model atmospheres that are roughly 0.1 dex higher
than corresponding abundances from 1D MARCS model atmospheres; these
differences go in the same direction as the non-LTE effects themselves.
We make available grids of departure coefficients, equivalent widths and
abundance corrections, calculated on 1D MARCS model atmospheres and
horizontally and temporally averaged 3D STAGGER model atmospheres.

	Abstract = {{We present and discuss new determinations of metallicity, rotation, age,
kinematics, and Galactic orbits for a complete, magnitude-limited, and
kinematically unbiased sample of 16 682 nearby F and G dwarf stars. Our
{\tilde}63 000 new, accurate radial-velocity observations for nearly 13
500 stars allow identification of most of the binary stars in the sample
and, together with published uvby{$\beta$} photometry, Hipparcos
parallaxes, Tycho-2 proper motions, and a few earlier radial velocities,
complete the kinematic information for 14 139 stars. These high-quality
velocity data are supplemented by effective temperatures and
metallicities newly derived from recent and/or revised calibrations. The
remaining stars either lack Hipparcos data or have fast rotation.  A
major effort has been devoted to the determination of new isochrone ages
for all stars for which this is possible. Particular attention has been
given to a realistic treatment of statistical biases and error
estimates, as standard techniques tend to underestimate these effects
and introduce spurious features in the age distributions. Our ages agree
well with those by Edvardsson et al. ($\backslash$cite$\{$edv93$\}$), despite several
astrophysical and computational improvements since then. We demonstrate,
however, how strong observational and theoretical biases cause the
distribution of the observed ages to be very different from that of the
true age distribution of the sample.  Among the many basic relations of
the Galactic disk that can be reinvestigated from the data presented
here, we revisit the metallicity distribution of the G dwarfs and the
age-metallicity, age-velocity, and metallicity-velocity relations of the
Solar neighbourhood. Our first results confirm the lack of metal-poor G
dwarfs relative to closed-box model predictions (the ``G dwarf
problem''), the existence of radial metallicity gradients in the disk,
the small change in mean metallicity of the thin disk since its
formation and the substantial scatter in metallicity at all ages, and
the continuing kinematic heating of the thin disk with an efficiency
consistent with that expected for a combination of spiral arms and giant
molecular clouds. Distinct features in the distribution of the V
component of the space motion are extended in age and metallicity,
corresponding to the effects of stochastic spiral waves rather than
classical moving groups, and may complicate the identification of
thick-disk stars from kinematic criteria. More advanced analyses of this
rich material will require careful simulations of the selection criteria
for the sample and the distribution of observational errors.

Based on observations made with the Danish 1.5-m telescope at ESO, La
Silla, Chile, and with the Swiss 1-m telescope at Observatoire de
Haute-Provence, France.

	Abstract = {{We show that the masses of red giant stars can be well predicted from
their photospheric carbon and nitrogen abundances, in conjunction with
their spectroscopic stellar labels log g, T$_{eff}$, and [Fe/H].
This is qualitatively expected from mass-dependent post-main-sequence
evolution. We here establish an empirical relation between these
quantities by drawing on 1475 red giants with asteroseismic mass
estimates from Kepler that also have spectroscopic labels from Apache
Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE) DR12. We assess
the accuracy of our model, and find that it predicts stellar masses with
fractional rms errors of about 14 per cent (typically 0.2
M$_{&sun;}$). From these masses, we derive ages with rms errors of
40 per cent. This empirical model allows us for the first time to make
age determinations (in the range 1-13 Gyr) for vast numbers of giant
stars across the Galaxy. We apply our model to {\tilde}52 000 stars in
APOGEE DR12, for which no direct mass and age information was previously
available. We find that these estimates highlight the vertical age
structure of the Milky Way disc, and that the relation of age with
[{$\alpha$}/M] and metallicity is broadly consistent with established
expectations based on detailed studies of the solar neighbourhood.

	Abstract = {{The mass of a star is arguably its most fundamental parameter. For red
giant stars, tracers luminous enough to be observed across the Galaxy,
mass implies a stellar evolution age. It has proven to be extremely
difficult to infer ages and masses directly from red giant spectra using
existing methods. From the Kepler and apogee surveys, samples of several
thousand stars exist with high-quality spectra and asteroseismic masses.
Here we show that from these data we can build a data-driven spectral
model using The Cannon, which can determine stellar masses to
{\tilde}0.07 dex from apogee dr12 spectra of red giants; these imply age
estimates accurate to {\tilde}0.2 dex (40\%). We show that The Cannon
constrains these ages foremost from spectral regions with CN absorption
lines, elements whose surface abundances reflect mass-dependent
dredge-up. We deliver an unprecedented catalog of 70,000 giants
(including 20,000 red clump stars) with mass and age estimates, spanning
the entire disk (from the Galactic center to R{\tilde} 20 kpc). We show
that the age information in the spectra is not simply a corollary of the
birth-material abundances $\{$$\{$[Fe/H]$\}$$\}$ and [{$\alpha$} /$\{$Fe$\}$], and that, even
within a monoabundance population of stars, there are age variations
that vary sensibly with Galactic position. Such stellar age constraints
across the Milky Way open up new avenues in Galactic archeology.

Anglo-Australian Observatory. The RAVE program started in 2003,
obtaining medium-resolution spectra (median R=7500) in the Ca-triplet
region (8410-8795 {\AA}) for southern hemisphere stars drawn from the
Tycho-2 and SuperCOSMOS catalogs, in the magnitude range 9$\lt$I$\lt$12.
The first data release is described in this paper and contains radial
velocities for 24,748 individual stars (25,274 measurements when
including reobservations). Those data were obtained on 67 nights between
2003 April 11 and 2004 April 3. The total sky coverage within this data
release is \~{}4760 deg$^{2}$. The average signal-to-noise ratio of
the observed spectra is 29.5, and 80\% of the radial velocities have
uncertainties better than 3.4 km s$^{-1}$. Combining internal
errors and zero-point errors, the mode is found to be 2 km
s$^{-1}$. Repeat observations are used to assess the stability of
our radial velocity solution, resulting in a variance of 2.8 km
s$^{-1}$. We demonstrate that the radial velocities derived for
the first data set do not show any systematic trend with color or
signal-to-noise ratio. The RAVE radial velocities are complemented in
the data release with proper motions from Starnet 2.0, Tycho-2, and
SuperCOSMOS, in addition to photometric data from the major optical and
infrared catalogs (Tycho-2, USNO-B, DENIS, and the Two Micron All Sky
Survey). The data release can be accessed via the RAVE Web site.

	Abstract = {{It is now well-established that the elemental abundance patterns of
stars hold key clues not only to their formation, but also to the
assembly histories of galaxies. One of the most exciting possibilities
is the use of stellar abundance patterns as {\ldquo}chemical tags{\rdquo}
to identify stars that were born in the same molecular cloud. In this
paper, we assess the prospects of chemical tagging as a function of
several key underlying parameters. We show that in the fiducial case of
10$^{4}$ distinct cells in chemical space and
$\{$10$\}$$^{5}$-$\{$10$\}$$^{6}$ stars in the survey, one can expect to
detect {\sim} $\{$10$\}$$^{2}$-$\{$10$\}$$^{3}$ groups that are {\ge}slant
5{$\sigma$}  overdensities in the chemical space. However, we find that
even very large overdensities in chemical space do not guarantee that
the overdensity is due to a single set of stars from a common birth
cloud. In fact, for our fiducial model parameters, the typical 5{$\sigma$} 
overdensity is comprised of stars from a wide range of clusters with the
most dominant cluster contributing only 25\% of the stars. The most
important factors limiting the identification of disrupted clusters via
chemical tagging are the number of chemical cells in the chemical space
and the survey sampling rate of the underlying stellar population. Both
of these factors can be improved through strategic observational plans.
While recovering individual clusters through chemical tagging may prove
challenging, we show, in agreement with previous work, that different
CMFs imprint different degrees of clumpiness in chemical space. These
differences provide the opportunity to statistically reconstruct the
slope and high-mass cutoff of CMF and its evolution through cosmic time.

	Abstract = {{Globular clusters are tracers of the history of star formation and
chemical enrichment in the early Galaxy. Their abundance pattern can
help understanding their chemical enrichment processes. In particular,
the iron-peak elements have been relatively little studied so far in the
Galactic bulge. The abundances of iron-peak elements are derived for the
sample clusters, and compared with bulge field, and thick disk stars. We
derive abundances of the iron-peak elements Sc, V, Mn, Cu, and Zn in
individual stars of five bulge globular clusters (NGC 6528, NGC 6553,
NGC 6522, NGC 6558, HP1), and of the reference thick disk/inner halo
cluster 47 Tucanae (NGC 104). High resolution spectra were obtained with
the UVES spectrograph at the Very Large Telescope over the years. The
sample globular clusters studied span metallicities in the range
-1.2$\lt$Fe/H]$\lt$0.0. V and Sc appear to vary in lockstep with Fe,
indicating that they are produced in the same supernovae as Fe. We find
that Mn is deficient in metal-poor stars, confirming that it is
underproduced in massive stars; Mn-over-Fe steadily increases at the
higher metallicities due to a metallicity-dependent enrichment by
supernovae of type Ia. Cu behaves as a secondary element, indicating its
production in a weak-s process in massive stars. Zn has an alpha-like
behaviour at low metallicities, which can be explained in terms of
nucleosynthesis in hypernovae. At the metal-rich end, Zn decreases with
increasing metallicity, similarly to the alpha-elements.

@article{Nissen2014,
	Abstract = {{Context. Carbon and oxygen abundances in stars are important in many
fields of astrophysics including nucleosynthesis, stellar structure,
evolution of galaxies, and formation of planetary systems. Still, our
knowledge of the abundances of these elements in different stellar
populations is uncertain because of difficulties in observing and
analyzing atomic and molecular lines of C and O. <BR /> Aims: Abundances
of C, O, and Fe are determined for F and G main-sequence stars in the
solar neighborhood with metallicities in the range -1.6 $\lt$ [Fe/H] $\lt$
+0.4 in order to study trends and possible systematic differences in the
C/Fe, O/Fe, and C/O ratios for thin- and thick-disk stars as well as
high- and low-alpha halo stars. In addition, we investigate if there is
any connection between C and O abundances in stellar atmospheres and the
occurrence of planets. <BR /> Methods: Carbon abundances are determined
from the {$\lambda$}{$\lambda$} 5052,5380 C i lines and oxygen abundances from
the {$\lambda$}7774 O i triplet and the forbidden [O i] line at 6300
{\AA}. MARCS model atmospheres are applied and non-LTE corrections for
the O i triplet are included. <BR /> Results: Systematic differences
between high- and low-alpha halo stars and between thin- and thick-disk
stars are seen in the trends of [C/Fe] and [O/Fe]. The two halo
populations and thick-disk stars show the same trend of [C/O] versus
[O/H], whereas the thin-disk stars are shifted to higher [C/O] values.
Furthermore, we find some evidence of higher C/O and C/Fe ratios in
stars hosting planets than in stars for which no planets have been
detected. <BR /> Conclusions: The results suggest that C and O in both
high- and low-alpha halo stars and in thick-disk stars are made mainly
in massive (M$\gt$ 8 M$_{&sun;}$) stars, whereas thin-disk stars
have an additional carbon contribution from low-mass AGB and massive
stars of high metallicity causing a rising trend of the C/O ratio with
increasing metallicity. However, at the highest metallicities
investigated ([Fe/H] {\sime} + 0.4), C/O does not exceed 0.8, which seems
to exclude formation of carbon planets if proto-planetary disks have the
same composition as their parent stars.

	Abstract = {{We present a sample of 705 local giant stars observed using the New
Mexico State University 1 m telescope with the Sloan Digital Sky
Survey-III/Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment
(APOGEE) spectrograph, for which we estimate stellar ages and the local
star formation history (SFH). The high-resolution (R {\tilde} 22,500), near
infrared (1.51-1.7 {$\mu$}m) APOGEE spectra provide measurements of
stellar atmospheric parameters (temperature, surface gravity, [M/H], and
[{$\alpha$}/M]). Due to the smaller uncertainties in surface gravity
possible with high-resolution spectra and accurate Hipparcos distance
measurements, we are able to calculate the stellar masses to within 30\%.
For giants, the relatively rapid evolution up the red giant branch
allows the age to be constrained by the mass. We examine methods of
estimating age using both the mass-age relation directly and a
Bayesian isochrone matching of measured parameters, assuming a constant
SFH. To improve the SFH prior, we use a hierarchical modeling approach
to constrain the parameters of the model SFH using the age probability
distribution functions of the data. The results of an {$\alpha$}-dependent
Gaussian SFH model show a clear age-[{$\alpha$}/M] relation at all
ages. Using this SFH model as the prior for an empirical Bayesian
analysis, we determine ages for individual stars. The resulting
age-metallicity relation is flat, with a slight decrease in [M/H]
at the oldest ages and a {\tilde}0.5 dex spread in metallicity across most
ages. For stars with ages {\lsim}1 Gyr we find a smaller spread,
consistent with radial migration having a smaller effect on these young
stars than on the older stars.

accreting white dwarfs (WDs) in close binary systems are an
astrophysical site for the intermediate neutron-capture process. During

a split of the convection zone as it was seen in simulations of He-shell
flashes in post-AGB and low-Z asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars. We
estimate that for the production of first-peak heavy elements this site
can be of similar importance for galactic chemical evolution as the
s-process production by low-mass AGB stars. The He-shell flashes result
in the expansion and, ultimately, ejection of the accreted and then
I-process enriched material, via super-Eddington-luminosity winds or
Roche-lobe overflow. The WD models do not retain any significant amount
of the accreted mass, with a He retention efficiency of {\lsim} 10 \%
depending on mass and convective boundary mixing assumptions. This makes
the evolutionary path of such systems to supernova Ia explosion highly
unlikely.

	Abstract = {{Carbon-enhanced metal-poor (CEMP) stars in the Galactic Halo display
enrichments in heavy elements associated with either the s (slow) or the
r (rapid) neutron-capture process (e.g., barium and europium,
respectively), and in some cases they display evidence of both. The
abundance patterns of these CEMP-s/r stars, which show both Ba and Eu
enrichment, are particularly puzzling, since the s and the r processes
require neutron densities that are more than ten orders of magnitude
apart and, hence, are thought to occur in very different stellar sites
with very different physical conditions. We investigate whether the
abundance patterns of CEMP-s/r stars can arise from the nucleosynthesis
of the intermediate neutron-capture process (the I process), which is
characterized by neutron densities between those of the s and the r
processes. Using nuclear network calculations, we study neutron capture
nucleosynthesis at different constant neutron densities n ranging from
10$^{7}$-10$^{15}$ cm$^{-3}$. With respect to the
classical s process resulting from neutron densities on the lowest side
of this range, neutron densities on the highest side result in abundance
patterns, which show an increased production of heavy s-process and
r-process elements, but similar abundances of the light s-process
elements. Such high values of n may occur in the thermal pulses of
asymptotic giant branch stars due to proton ingestion episodes.
Comparison to the surface abundances of 20 CEMP-s/r stars shows that our
modeled I-process abundances successfully reproduce observed abundance
patterns, which could not be previously explained by s-process
nucleosynthesis. Because the I-process models fit the abundances of
CEMP-s/r stars so well, we propose that this class should be renamed as
CEMP-I.

	Abstract = {{The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS ) will search for
planets transiting bright and nearby stars. TESS has been selected by
NASA for launch in 2017 as an Astrophysics Explorer mission. The
spacecraft will be placed into a highly elliptical 13.7-day orbit around
the Earth. During its two-year mission, TESS will employ four wide-field
optical CCD cameras to monitor at least 200,000 main-sequence dwarf
stars with I$_{C}$ (approximately less than) 13 for temporary
drops in brightness caused by planetary transits. Each star will be
observed for an interval ranging from one month to one year, depending
mainly on the star's ecliptic latitude. The longest observing intervals
will be for stars near the ecliptic poles, which are the optimal
locations for follow-up observations with the James Webb Space
Telescope. Brightness measurements of preselected target stars will be
recorded every 2 min, and full frame images will be recorded every 30
min. TESS stars will be 10-100 times brighter than those surveyed by the
pioneering Kepler mission. This will make TESS planets easier to
characterize with follow-up observations. TESS is expected to find more
than a thousand planets smaller than Neptune, including dozens that are
comparable in size to the Earth. Public data releases will occur every
four months, inviting immediate community-wide efforts to study the new
planets. The TESS legacy will be a catalog of the nearest and brightest
stars hosting transiting planets, which will endure as highly favorable
targets for detailed investigations.

@article{Dotter2017,
	Abstract = {{In the era of large stellar spectroscopic surveys, there is an emphasis
on deriving not only stellar abundances but also the ages for millions
of stars. In the context of Galactic archeology, stellar ages provide a
direct probe of the formation history of the Galaxy. We use the stellar
evolution code MESA to compute models with atomic diffusion{\mdash}with
and without radiative acceleration{\mdash}and extra mixing in the surface
layers. The extra mixing consists of both density-dependent turbulent
mixing and envelope overshoot mixing. Based on these models we argue
that it is important to distinguish between initial, bulk abundances
(parameters) and current, surface abundances (variables) in the analysis
of individual stellar ages. In stars that maintain radiative regions on
evolutionary timescales, atomic diffusion modifies the surface
abundances. We show that when initial, bulk metallicity is equated with
current, surface metallicity in isochrone age analysis, the resulting
stellar ages can be systematically overestimated by up to 20\%. The
change of surface abundances with evolutionary phase also complicates
chemical tagging, which is the concept that dispersed star clusters can
be identified through unique, high-dimensional chemical signatures.
Stars from the same cluster, but in different evolutionary phases, will
show different surface abundances. We speculate that calibration of
stellar models may allow us to estimate not only stellar ages but also
initial abundances for individual stars. In the meantime, analyzing the
chemical properties of stars in similar evolutionary phases is essential
to minimize the effects of atomic diffusion in the context of chemical
tagging.

	Abstract = {{Recent works have shown how the [C/N] ratio in stars after the first
dredge-up (FDU) can be used as an age estimator in virtue of its
dependence on stellar mass. For this purpose, precise predictions of the
surface chemical composition before and after the mixing takes place in
the convective envelope of subgiant stars are necessary. Stellar
evolution models can provide us with such predictions, although a
comparison with objects of known age is needed for calibration. Open
clusters are excellent test cases, as they represent a single stellar
population for which the age can be derived through, e.g. isochrone
fitting. In this study, we present a detailed analysis of stars
belonging to the well-known open cluster M67 observed by the Apache
Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE) survey in the
twelfth data release of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and whose chemical
properties were derived with the APOGEE Stellar Parameters and Chemical
Abundances Pipeline. We find that the [C/N] abundance of subgiant branch
stars is overestimated by {\tilde}0.2 dex due to an offset in the
determination of the [N/Fe] abundance. Stars on the red giant branch and
red clump are shown not to be affected by this offset. We derive
[C/N]$_{FDU}$ = -0.46 {\plusmn} 0.03 dex, which poses a strong
constraint on calibrations of [C/N]$_{FDU}$ as age indicator. We
also do not find any clear signature of additional chemical mixing
processes that set in after the red giant branch bump. The results
obtained for M67 indicate the importance of conducting high-resolution
spectroscopic studies of open clusters of different ages in order to
establish an accurate age-dating method for field stars.

@article{Hayden2017,
	Abstract = {{We analyze 494 main sequence turnoff and subgiant stars from the
AMBRE:HARPS survey. These stars have accurate astrometric information
from Gaia DR1, providing reliable age estimates with relative
uncertainties of {\plusmn}1 or 2 Gyr and allowing precise orbital
determinations. The sample is split based on chemistry into a
low-[Mg/Fe] sequence, which are often identified as thin disk stellar
populations, and high-[Mg/Fe] sequence, which are often associated with
thick disk stellar populations. We find that the high-[Mg/Fe] chemical
sequence has extended star formation for several Gyr and is coeval with
the oldest stars of the low-[Mg/Fe] chemical sequence: both the low- and
high-[Mg/Fe] sequences were forming stars at the same time. We find that
the high-[Mg/Fe] stellar populations are only vertically extended for
the oldest, most-metal poor and highest [Mg/Fe] stars. When comparing
vertical velocity dispersion for the low- and high-[Mg/Fe] sequences,
the high-[Mg/Fe] sequence has lower vertical velocity dispersion than
the low-[Mg/Fe] sequence for stars of similar age. This means that
identifying either group as thin or thick disk based on chemistry is
misleading. The stars belonging to the high-[Mg/Fe] sequence have
perigalacticons that originate in the inner disk, while the
perigalacticons of stars on the low-[Mg/Fe] sequence are generally
around the solar neighborhood. From the orbital properties of the stars,
the high-[Mg/Fe] and low-[Mg/Fe] sequences are most likely a reflection
of the chemical enrichment history of the inner and outer disk
populations, respectively; radial mixing causes both populations to be
observed in situ at the solar position. Based on these results, we
emphasize that it is important to be clear in defining what populations
are being referenced when using the terms thin and thick disk, and that
ideally the term thick disk should be reserved for purely geometric
definitions to avoid confusion and be consistent with definitions in
external galaxies.

110,000), high signal-to-noise ratio (800-1,000) Very Large Telescope
UVES spectra, which allow us to achieve a precision of about 0.005 dex

[Fe/H] = 0.054 {\plusmn} 0.005 dex, and its microturbulence velocity is
+0.02 {\plusmn} 0.01 km s$^{-1}$ higher than solar. Our
precise stellar parameters and differential isochrone analysis show that
18 Sco has a mass of 1.04 {\plusmn} 0.02 M $_{&sun;}$ and that it

velocity Planet Searcher (HARPS) radial velocities to search for
planets, but none are detected. The chemical abundance pattern of 18 Sco
displays a clear trend with condensation temperature, thus showing
higher abundances of refractories in 18 Sco than in the Sun.
Intriguingly, there are enhancements in the neutron-capture elements
relative to the Sun. Despite the small element-to-element abundance
differences among nearby n-capture elements (\~{}0.02 dex), we successfully
reproduce the r-process pattern in the Solar System. This is independent
evidence for the universality of the r process. Our results have
important implications for chemical tagging in our Galaxy and
nucleosynthesis in general.

	Abstract = {{The chemical composition of the Sun is an essential piece of reference
data for astronomy, cosmology, astroparticle, space and geo-physics:
elemental abundances of essentially all astronomical objects are
referenced to the solar composition, and basically every process
involving the Sun depends on its composition. This article, dealing with
the intermediate-mass elements Na to Ca, is the first in a series
describing the comprehensive re-determination of the solar composition.
In this series we severely scrutinise all ingredients of the analysis
across all elements, to obtain the most accurate, homogeneous and
reliable results possible. We employ a highly realistic 3D hydrodynamic
model of the solar photosphere, which has successfully passed an arsenal
of observational diagnostics. For comparison, and to quantify remaining
systematic errors, we repeat the analysis using three different 1D
hydrostatic model atmospheres (marcs, miss and Holweger {\amp}
M{\"u}ller 1974, Sol. Phys., 39, 19) and a horizontally and
temporally-averaged version of the 3D model ({\mlab} 3D {\mrab}). We
account for departures from local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE)
wherever possible. We have scoured the literature for the best possible
input data, carefully assessing transition probabilities, hyperfine
splitting, partition functions and other data for inclusion in the
analysis. We have put the lines we use through a very stringent quality
check in terms of their observed profiles and atomic data, and discarded
all that we suspect to be blended. Our final recommended 3D+NLTE
abundances are: log {$\epsilon$}$_{Na}$ = 6.21 {\plusmn} 0.04, log
{$\epsilon$}$_{Mg}$ = 7.59 {\plusmn} 0.04, log {$\epsilon$}$_{Al}$
= 6.43 {\plusmn} 0.04, log {$\epsilon$}$_{Si}$ = 7.51 {\plusmn} 0.03,
log {$\epsilon$}$_{P}$ = 5.41 {\plusmn} 0.03, log
{$\epsilon$}$_{S}$ = 7.13 {\plusmn} 0.03, log {$\epsilon$}$_{K}$ =
5.04 {\plusmn} 0.05 and log {$\epsilon$}$_{Ca}$ = 6.32 {\plusmn} 0.03.
The uncertainties include both statistical and systematic errors. Our
results are systematically smaller than most previous ones with the 1D
semi-empirical Holweger {\amp} M{\"u}ller model, whereas the {\mlab} 3D
{\mrab} model returns abundances very similar to the full 3D
calculations. This analysis provides a complete description and a slight
update of the results presented in Asplund et al. (2009, ARA{\amp}A, 47,
481) for Na to Ca, and includes full details of all lines and input data
used.

	Abstract = {{The solar chemical composition is an important ingredient in our
understanding of the formation, structure, and evolution of both the Sun
and our Solar System. Furthermore, it is an essential reference standard
against which the elemental contents of other astronomical objects are
compared. In this review, we evaluate the current understanding of the
solar photospheric composition. In particular, we present a
redetermination of the abundances of nearly all available elements,
using a realistic new three-dimensional (3D), time-dependent
hydrodynamical model of the solar atmosphere. We have carefully
considered the atomic input data and selection of spectral lines, and
accounted for departures from local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE)
whenever possible. The end result is a comprehensive and homogeneous
compilation of the solar elemental abundances. Particularly noteworthy
findings are significantly lower abundances of C, N, O, and Ne compared
to the widely used values of a decade ago. The new solar chemical
composition is supported by a high degree of internal consistency
between available abundance indicators, and by agreement with values
obtained in the Solar Neighborhood and from the most pristine
meteorites. There is, however, a stark conflict with standard models of
the solar interior according to helioseismology, a discrepancy that has
yet to find a satisfactory resolution.

	Abstract = {{We have shown that data-driven models are effective for inferring
physical attributes of stars (labels; Teff, logg, [M/H]) from spectra,
even when the signal-to-noise ratio is low. Here we explore whether this
is possible when the dimensionality of the label space is large (Teff,
logg, and 15 abundances: C, N, O, Na, Mg, Al, Si, S, K, Ca, Ti, V, Mn,
Fe, Ni) and the model is non-linear in its response to abundance and
parameter changes. We adopt ideas from compressed sensing to limit
overall model complexity while retaining model freedom. The model is
trained with a set of 12,681 red-giant stars with high signal-to-noise
spectroscopic observations and stellar parameters and abundances taken
from the APOGEE Survey. We find that we can successfully train and use a
model with 17 stellar labels. Validation shows that the model does a
good job of inferring all 17 labels (typical abundance precision is 0.04
dex), even when we degrade the signal-to-noise by discarding \~{}50\% of the
observing time. The model dependencies make sense: the spectral
derivatives with respect to abundances correlate with known atomic
lines, and we identify elements belonging to atomic lines that were
previously unknown. We recover (anti-)correlations in abundance labels
for globular cluster stars, consistent with the literature. However we
find the intrinsic spread in globular cluster abundances is 3--4 times
smaller than previously reported. We deliver 17 labels with associated
errors for 87,563 red giant stars, as well as open-source code to extend
this work to other spectroscopic surveys.

@article{Ho2017,
	Abstract = {{In this era of large-scale spectroscopic stellar surveys, measurements
of stellar attributes ({\ldquo}labels,{\rdquo} i.e., parameters and
abundances) must be made precise and consistent across surveys. Here, we
demonstrate that this can be achieved by a data-driven approach to
spectral modeling. With The Cannon, we transfer information from the
APOGEE survey to determine precise $\{$T$\}$$_{{eff}$$\}$, $\{$log$\}$
$\{$$\backslash$text$\{$$\}$$\}$g, [$\{$Fe$\}$/$\{$$\{$H$\}$$\}$], and [{$\alpha$} /$\{$$\{$M$\}$$\}$] from the spectra of
450,000 LAMOST giants. The Cannon fits a predictive model for LAMOST
spectra using 9952 stars observed in common between the two surveys,
taking five labels from APOGEE DR12 as ground truth $\{$T$\}$$_{{eff}$$\}$,
$\{$log$\}$ $\{$$\backslash$text$\{$$\}$$\}$g, [$\{$Fe$\}$/$\{$$\{$H$\}$$\}$], [{$\alpha$} /$\{$$\{$M$\}$$\}$], and K-band extinction
$\{$A$\}$$_{{{k}$$\}$$\}$. The model is then used to infer
$\{$T$\}$$_{{eff}$$\}$, $\{$log$\}$ $\{$$\backslash$text$\{$$\}$$\}$g, [$\{$Fe$\}$/$\{$$\{$H$\}$$\}$], and [{$\alpha$}
/$\{$$\{$M$\}$$\}$] for 454,180 giants, 20\% of the LAMOST DR2 stellar sample. These
are the first [{$\alpha$} /$\{$$\{$M$\}$$\}$] values for the full set of LAMOST giants,
and the largest catalog of [{$\alpha$} /$\{$$\{$M$\}$$\}$] for giant stars to date.
Furthermore, these labels are by construction on the APOGEE label scale;
for spectra with S/N $\gt$ 50, cross-validation of the model yields
typical uncertainties of 70 K in $\{$T$\}$$_{{eff}$$\}$, 0.1 in $\{$log$\}$
$\{$$\backslash$text$\{$$\}$$\}$g, 0.1 in [$\{$Fe$\}$/$\{$$\{$H$\}$$\}$], and 0.04 in [{$\alpha$} /$\{$$\{$M$\}$$\}$], values
comparable to the broadly stated, conservative APOGEE DR12
uncertainties. Thus, by using {\ldquo}label transfer{\rdquo} to tie
low-resolution (LAMOST R {\ap} 1800) spectra to the label scale of a much
higher-resolution (APOGEE R {\ap} 22,500) survey, we substantially reduce
the inconsistencies between labels measured by the individual survey
pipelines. This demonstrates that label transfer with The Cannon can
successfully bring different surveys onto the same physical scale.

Anglo-Australian Telescope's 2dF/HERMES (High Efficiency and Resolution

Averaged spectral fluxes of stars were compared to their photometry to
determine the relative throughputs of fibres for a range of fibre
position and atmospheric conditions. We find that overall the
throughputs of the 771 usable fibres have been stable over the first two
years of its operation. About 2.5 per cent of fibres have throughputs
much lower than the average. There are also a number of yet unexplained
variations between the HERMES bandpasses, and mechanically and optically
linked fibre groups known as retractors or slitlets related to regions
of the focal plane. These findings do not impact the science that HERMES
will produce.

	Abstract = {{We present a comprehensive study of the evolution of the abundances of
intermediate mass elements, from C to Zn, in the Milky Way halo and in
the local disk. We use a consistent model to describe the evolution of
those two galactic subsystems. The halo and the disk are assumed to
evolve independently, both starting with gas of primordial composition,
and in different ways: strong outflow is assumed to take place during
the \~{} 1 Gyr of the halo formation, while the disk is built by slowly
infalling gas. This description of the halo+disk evolution can correctly
account for the main observational constraints (at least in the
framework of simple models of galactic chemical evolution). We utilise
then metallicity dependent yields to study the evolution of all elements
from C and Zn. Comparing our results to an extensive body of
observational data (including very recent ones), we are able to make a
critical analysis of the successes and shortcomings of current yields of
massive stars. Finally, we discuss qualitatively some possible ways to
interpret the recent data on oxygen vs iron, which suggest that oxygen
behaves differently from the other alpha-elements.

@article{Lind2009b,
	Abstract = {{Context: To alleviate the discrepancy between the prediction of the
primordial lithium abundance in the universe and the abundances observed
in Pop II dwarfs and subgiant stars, it has been suggested that the
stars observable today have undergone photospheric depletion of lithium.
<BR />Aims: To identify the cause of this depletion, it is important to
accurately establish the behaviour of lithium abundance with effective
temperature and evolutionary phase. Stars in globular clusters are ideal
objects for such an abundance analysis, because relative stellar
parameters can be determined precisely.  <BR />Methods: We conducted a
homogeneous analysis of a very large sample of stars in the metal-poor
globular cluster NGC 6397, covering all evolutionary phases from below
the main sequence turn-off to high up on the red giant branch. Non-LTE
Li abundances or abundance upper limits were obtained for all stars, and
for a sizeable subset of the targets sodium abundances were also
obtained. The Na abundances were used to distinguish stars formed out of
pristine material from stars formed out of material affected by
pollution from a previous generation of more massive stars.  <BR
/>Results: The dwarf, turn-off, and early subgiant stars in our sample
form a thin abundance plateau, disrupted in the middle of the subgiant
branch by the Li dilution caused by the first dredge-up. A second steep
abundance drop is seen at the luminosity of the red giant branch bump.
The turn-off stars are more Li-poor, by up to 0.1 dex, than subgiants
that have not yet undergone dredge-up. In addition, hotter dwarfs are
slightly more Li-poor than cooler dwarfs, which may be a signature of
the so-called Li dip in the cluster, commonly seen among Pop I stars.
The feature is however weak. A considerably wide spread in Na abundance
confirms that NGC 6397 has suffered from intracluster pollution in its
infancy and a limited number of Na-enhanced and Li-deficient stars
strongly contribute to forming a significant anti-correlation between
the abundances of Na and Li. It is nevertheless seen that Li abundances
are unaffected by relatively high degrees of pollution. Lithium
abundance trends with effective temperature and stellar luminosity are
compared to predictions from stellar structure models including atomic
diffusion and ad-hoc turbulence below the convection zone. We confirm
previous findings that some turbulence, with strict limits to its
efficiency, is necessary for explaining the observations.

	Abstract = {{The primary sample of the Gaia Data Release 1 is the Tycho-Gaia
Astrometric Solution (TGAS): {\ap}2 million Tycho-2 sources with improved
parallaxes and proper motions relative to the initial catalog. This
increased astrometric precision presents an opportunity to find new
binary stars and moving groups. We search for high-confidence comoving
pairs of stars in TGAS by identifying pairs of stars consistent with
having the same 3D velocity using a marginalized likelihood ratio test
to discriminate candidate comoving pairs from the field population.
Although we perform some visualizations using (bias-corrected) inverse
parallax as a point estimate of distance, the likelihood ratio is
computed with a probabilistic model that includes the covariances of
parallax and proper motions and marginalizes the (unknown) true
distances and 3D velocities of the stars. We find 13,085 comoving star
pairs among 10,606 unique stars with separations as large as 10 pc (our
search limit). Some of these pairs form larger groups through mutual
comoving neighbors: many of these pair networks correspond to known open
clusters and OB associations, but we also report the discovery of
several new comoving groups. Most surprisingly, we find a large number
of very wide ($\gt$ 1 pc) separation comoving star pairs, the number of
which increases with increasing separation and cannot be explained
purely by false-positive contamination. Our key result is a catalog of
high-confidence comoving pairs of stars in TGAS. We discuss the utility
of this catalog for making dynamical inferences about the Galaxy,
testing stellar atmosphere models, and validating chemical abundance
measurements.

219025 forms a remarkable ensemble of single K giants with the unique
properties of rapid rotation, very strong Li lines, an asymmetrical
H{$\alpha$} profile, and a large far-infrared excess. Their vsini values
are between 18 and 23 km s$^{-1}$, and their LTE Li abundances,

reveals it to be a \~{}1 M$_{solar}$ giant with a value of
$^{12}$C/$^{13}$C approximately equal to 12. A clear
relation between high rotational velocities and very high Li abundances
for K giant stars is found only when asymmetrical H{$\alpha$} profiles and
large far-infrared excesses are present. If we consider single K giants,
we find that among rapid (vsini$\gt$=8 km s$^{-1}$) rotators, a
very large proportion (\~{}50\%) are Li-rich giants. This proportion is in
contrast with a very low proportion (\~{}2\%) of Li-rich stars among the
much more common slowly rotating K giants. This striking difference is
discussed in terms of proposed mechanisms for Li enrichment.

	Abstract = {{Hydrocarbon organic material, as found in the interstellar medium,
exists in complex mixtures of aromatic and aliphatic forms. It is
considered to originate from carbon-enriched giant stars during their
final stages of evolution, when very strong mass loss occurs in a few
thousand years on their way to becoming planetary nebulae. We show here
that the same organic compounds appear to be formed in previous stages
of the evolution of giant stars, more specifically, during the
first-ascending giant branch K-type stars. According to our model, this
happens only when these stars are being abruptly enriched with lithium,
together with the formation of a circumstellar shell with a strong mass
loss during just a few thousand years. This sudden mass loss is, on
average, a thousand times larger than that of normal Li-poor K giant
stars. This shell would later be detached, especially when the star
stops its Li enrichment and a rapid photospheric Li depletion occurs. In
order to gain extra carbon-based material to form the organic
hydrocarbons, as well as to explain the presence of complex inorganic
compounds in these stars, we propose an interaction of these strong
winds with the remaining asteroidal/cometary disks that already existed
around these stars since they were dwarf A-type stars. The mechanism of
interaction presented here is successful in explaining the presence of
inorganic compounds however, it is unable to produce new carbon-free
atoms to form the organic hydrocarbon compounds. Finally, we discuss
some suggestions and speculations that can eventually help solve the
long-standing puzzle of Li-rich giants.

	Abstract = {{We perform non-LTE calculations of lithium in late-type stars for a wide
range of stellar parameters, including quantum mechanical cross-sections
for collisions with neutral hydrogen and the negative hydrogen ion.
Non-LTE abundance corrections for the lithium resonance line at 670.7 nm
and the subordinate line at 610.3 nm, are calculated using 1D MARCS
model atmospheres spanning a grid T\_eff = [4000, 8000] K, log g = [1.0,
5.0], and [Fe/H] = [0.0, -3.0], for lithium abundances in the range
A(Li) = [-0.3, 4.2]. The competing effects of ultraviolet
over-ionization and photon losses in the resonance line govern the
behaviour of the non-LTE effects with stellar parameters and lithium
abundance. The size and sign of the non-LTE abundance corrections vary
significantly over the grid for the 670.7 nm line, but are typically
positive and below 0.15 dex for the 610.3 nm, line. The new collisional
data play a significant role in determining the abundance corrections.

	Abstract = {{We report the discovery of eight lithium-rich field giants found in a
high-resolution spectroscopic sample of over 700 metal-poor stars
([Fe/H] $\lt$ -0.5) selected from the Radial Velocity Experiment survey.
The majority of the Li-rich giants in our sample are very metal-poor
([Fe/H] $\lt$\~{} -1.9), and have a Li abundance (in the form of
$^{7}$Li), A(Li) = log (n(Li)/n(H)) + 12, between 2.30 and 3.63,
well above the typical upper red giant branch (RGB) limit, A(Li) $\lt$
0.5, while two stars, with A(Li) \~{} 1.7-1.8, show similar lithium
abundances to normal giants at the same gravity. We further included two
metal-poor, Li-rich globular cluster giants in our sample, namely the
previously discovered M3-IV101 and newly discovered (in this work)
M68-A96. This comprises the largest sample of metal-poor Li-rich giants
to date. We performed a detailed abundance analysis of all stars,
finding that the majority of our sample stars have elemental abundances
similar to that of Li-normal halo giants. Although the evolutionary
phase of each Li-rich giant cannot be definitively determined, the
Li-rich phase is likely connected to extra mixing at the RGB bump or
early asymptotic giant branch that triggers cool bottom processing in
which the bottom of the outer convective envelope is connected to the
H-burning shell in the star. The surface of a star becomes Li-enhanced
as $^{7}$Be (which burns to $^{7}$Li) is transported to the
stellar surface via the Cameron-Fowler mechanism. We discuss and
discriminate among several models for the extra mixing that can cause Li
production, given the detailed abundances of the Li-rich giants in our
sample.

@article{Asplund2006,
	Abstract = {{Very high quality spectra of 24 metal-poor halo dwarfs and subgiants
have been acquired with ESO's VLT/UVES for the purpose of determining Li
isotopic abundances. The derived one-dimensional, non-LTE $^{
7}$Li abundances from the Li I 670.8 nm line reveal a pronounced
dependence on metallicity but with negligible scatter around this trend.
Very good agreement is found between the abundances from the Li I 670.8
nm line and the Li I 610.4 nm line. The estimated primordial $^{
7}$Li abundance is
$^{7}$Li/H=(1.1-1.5){\times}10$^{-10}$, which is a factor of
3-4 lower than predicted from standard big bang nucleosynthesis with the
baryon density inferred from the cosmic microwave background.
Interestingly, $^{6}$Li is detected in 9 of our 24 stars at the
$\gt$=2 {$\sigma$} significance level. Our observations suggest the
existence of a $^{ 6}$Li plateau at the level of
log{$\epsilon$}$_{<SUP>6</SUP>Li}$\~{}0.8 however, taking into account
predictions for $^{6}$Li destruction during the pre-main-sequence
evolution tilts the plateau such that the $^{6}$Li abundances
apparently increase with metallicity. Our most noteworthy result is the
detection of $^{6}$Li in the very metal-poor star LP 815-43. Such
a high $^{6}$Li abundance during these early Galactic epochs is
very difficult to achieve by Galactic cosmic-ray spallation and
{$\alpha$}-fusion reactions. It is concluded that both Li isotopes have a
pre-Galactic origin. Possible $^{6}$Li production channels include
protogalactic shocks and late-decaying or annihilating supersymmetric
particles during the era of big bang nucleosynthesis. The presence of
$^{6}$Li limits the possible degree of stellar $^{ 7}$Li
depletion and thus sharpens the discrepancy with standard big bang
nucleosynthesis.

@article{Mints2017,
	Abstract = {{Context. Galactic archaeology, the study of the formation and evolution
of the Milky Way by reconstructing its past from its current
constituents, requires precise and accurate knowledge of stellar
parameters for as many stars as possible. To achieve this, a number of
large spectroscopic surveys have been undertaken and are still ongoing.
<BR /> Aims: So far consortia carrying out the different spectroscopic
surveys have used different tools to determine stellar parameters of
stars from their derived effective temperatures (T$_{eff}$),
surface gravities (log g), and metallicities ([Fe/H]); the parameters
can be combined with photometric, astrometric, interferometric, or
asteroseismic information. Here we aim to homogenise the stellar
characterisation by applying a unified tool to a large set of publicly
available spectrophotometric data. <BR /> Methods: We used spectroscopic
data from a variety of large surveys combined with infrared photometry
from 2MASS and AllWISE and compared these in a Bayesian manner with
PARSEC isochrones to derive probability density functions (PDFs) for
stellar masses, ages, and distances. We treated PDFs of pre-helium-core
burning, helium-core burning, and post helium-core burning solutions as
well as different peaks in multimodal PDFs (i.e. each unimodal sub-PDF)
of the different evolutionary phases separately. <BR /> Results: For
over 2.5 million stars we report mass, age, and distance estimates for
each evolutionary phase and unimodal sub-PDF. We report Gaussian,
skewed, Gaussian, truncated Gaussian, modified truncated exponential
distribution or truncated Student's t-distribution functions to
represent each sub-PDF, allowing us to reconstruct detailed PDFs.
Comparisons with stellar parameter estimates from the literature show
good agreement within uncertainties. <BR /> Conclusions: We present
UniDAM, the unified tool applicable to spectrophotometric data of
different surveys, to obtain a homogenised set of stellar parameters.

	Abstract = {{Context. We have entered an era of large spectroscopic surveys in which
we can measure, through automated pipelines, the atmospheric parameters
and chemical abundances for large numbers of stars. Calibrating these
survey pipelines using a set of ``benchmark stars'' in order to evaluate
the accuracy and precision of the provided parameters and abundances is
of utmost importance. The recent proposed set of Gaia FGK benchmark
stars has up to five metal-poor stars but no recommended stars within
-2.0 $\lt$ [Fe/H] $\lt$ -1.0 dex. However, this metallicity regime is
critical to calibrate properly. <BR /> Aims: In this paper, we aim to
add candidate Gaia benchmark stars inside of this metal-poor gap. We
began with a sample of 21 metal-poor stars which was reduced to 10 stars
by requiring accurate photometry and parallaxes, and high-resolution
archival spectra. <BR /> Methods: The procedure used to determine the
stellar parameters was similar to the previous works in this series for
consistency. The difference was to homogeneously determine the angular
diameter and effective temperature (T$_{eff}$) of all of our stars
using the Infrared Flux Method utilizing multi-band photometry. The
surface gravity (log g) was determined through fitting stellar
evolutionary tracks. The [Fe/H] was determined using four different
spectroscopic methods fixing the T$_{eff}$ and log g from the
values determined independent of spectroscopy. <BR /> Results: We
discuss, star-by-star, the quality of each parameter including how it
compares to literature, how it compares to a spectroscopic run where all
parameters are free, and whether Fe i ionisation-excitation balance is
achieved. <BR /> Conclusions: From the 10 stars, we recommend a sample
of five new metal-poor benchmark candidate stars which have consistent
T$_{eff}$, log g, and [Fe/H] determined through several means.
These stars, which are within -1.3 $\lt$ [Fe/H] $\lt$ -1.0, can be used
for calibration and validation purpose of stellar parameter and
abundance pipelines and should be of highest priority for future
interferometric studies.

	Abstract = {{The study of stellar parameters of planet-hosting stars, such as
metallicity and chemical abundances, help us to understand the theory of
planet formation and stellar evolution. Here, we present a catalogue of
accurate stellar atmospheric parameters and iron abundances for a sample
of 257 K and G field evolved stars that are being surveyed for planets
using precise radial-velocity measurements as part of the Coralie
programme to search for planets around giants. The analysis was done
using a set of high-resolution and high-signal-to-noise Ultraviolet and
Visible Echelle Spectrograph spectra. The stellar parameters were
derived using Fe I and II ionization and excitation equilibrium methods.
To take into account possible effects related to the choice of the lines
on the derived parameters, we used three different iron line-list sets
in our analysis, and the results differ among themselves by a small
factor for most of stars. For those stars with previous literature
parameter estimates, we found very good agreement with our own values.
In the present catalogue, we are providing new precise spectroscopic
measurements of effective temperature, surface gravity, microturbulence,
and metallicity for 190 stars for which it has not been found or
published in previous articles.

	Abstract = {{We performed a uniform and detailed abundance analysis of 12 refractory
elements (Na, Mg, Al, Si, Ca, Ti, Cr, Ni, Co, Sc, Mn, and V) for a
sample of 257 G- and K-type evolved stars from the CORALIE planet search
programme. To date, only one of these stars is known to harbour a
planetary companion. We aimed to characterize this large sample of
evolved stars in terms of chemical abundances and kinematics, thus
setting a solid base for further analysis of planetary properties around
giant stars. This sample, being homogeneously analysed, can be used as a
comparison sample for other planet-related studies, as well as for
different type of studies related to stellar and Galaxy astrophysics.
The abundances of the chemical elements were determined using an local
thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) abundance analysis relative to the Sun,
with the spectral synthesis code MOOG and a grid of Kurucz ATLAS9
atmospheres. To separate the Galactic stellar populations, both a purely
kinematical approach and a chemical method were applied. We confirm the
overabundance of Na in giant stars compared to the field FGK dwarfs.
This enhancement might have a stellar evolutionary character, but
departures from LTE may also produce a similar enhancement. Our chemical
separation of stellar populations also suggests a `gap' in metallicity
between the thick-disc and high-{$\alpha$} metal-rich stars, as previously
observed in dwarfs sample from HARPS. The present sample, as most of the
giant star samples, also suffers from the B - V colour cut-off, which
excludes low-log g stars with high metallicities, and high-log g star
with low [Fe/H]. For future studies of planet occurrence dependence on
stellar metallicity around these evolved stars, we suggest to use a
subsample of stars in a `cut-rectangle' in the log g-[Fe/H] diagram to
overcome the aforementioned issue.

@article{Jonsson2017,
	Abstract = {{Context. The Galactic bulge is an intriguing and significant part of our
Galaxy, but it is hard to observe because it is both distant and covered
by dust in the disk. Therefore, there are not many high-resolution
optical spectra of bulge stars with large wavelength coverage, whose
determined abundances can be compared with nearby, similarly analyzed
stellar samples. <BR /> Aims: We aim to determine the diagnostically
important alpha elements of a sample of bulge giants using
high-resolution optical spectra with large wavelength coverage. The
abundances found are compared to similarly derived abundances from
similar spectra of similar stars in the local thin and thick disks. In
this first paper we focus on the solar neighborhood reference sample.
<BR /> Methods: We used spectral synthesis to derive the stellar
parameters as well as the elemental abundances of both the local and
bulge samples of giants. We took special care to benchmark our method of
determining stellar parameters against independent measurements of
effective temperatures from angular diameter measurements and surface
gravities from asteroseismology. <BR /> Results: In this first paper we
present the method used to determine the stellar parameters and
elemental abundances, evaluate them, and present the results for our
local disk sample of 291 giants. <BR /> Conclusions: When comparing our
determined spectroscopic temperatures to those derived from angular
diameter measurements, we reproduce these with a systematic difference
of +10 K and a standard deviation of 53 K. The spectroscopic gravities
reproduce those determined from asteroseismology with a systematic
offset of +0.10 dex and a standard deviation of 0.12 dex. When it comes
to the abundance trends, our sample of local disk giants closely follows
trends found in other works analyzing solar neighborhood dwarfs, showing
that the much brighter giant stars are as good abundance probes as the
often used dwarfs.

	Abstract = {{Elemental abundances of stars are the result of the complex enrichment
history of their galaxy. Interpretation of observed abundances requires
flexible modeling tools to explore and quantify the information about
Galactic chemical evolution (GCE) stored in such data. Here we present
Chempy, a newly developed code for GCE modeling, representing a
parametrized open one-zone model within a Bayesian framework. A Chempy
model is specified by a set of five to ten parameters that describe the
effective galaxy evolution along with the stellar and star-formation
physics: for example, the star-formation history (SFH), the feedback
efficiency, the stellar initial mass function (IMF), and the incidence
of supernova of type Ia (SN Ia). Unlike established approaches, Chempy
can sample the posterior probability distribution in the full model
parameter space and test data-model matches for different
nucleosynthetic yield sets. It is essentially a chemical evolution
fitting tool. We straightforwardly extend Chempy to a multi-zone scheme.
As an illustrative application, we show that interesting parameter
constraints result from only the ages and elemental abundances of the
Sun, Arcturus, and the present-day interstellar medium (ISM). For the
first time, we use such information to infer the IMF parameter via GCE
modeling, where we properly marginalize over nuisance parameters and
account for different yield sets. We find that 11.6$^{+
2.1}$$_{-1.6}$\% of the IMF explodes as core-collapse supernova
(CC-SN), compatible with Salpeter (1955, ApJ, 121, 161). We also
constrain the incidence of SN Ia per 10$^{3}$M$_{&sun;}$ to
0.5-1.4. At the same time, this Chempy application shows persistent
discrepancies between predicted and observed abundances for some
elements, irrespective of the chosen yield set. These cannot be remedied
by any variations of Chempy's parameters and could be an indication of
missing nucleosynthetic channels. Chempy could be a powerful tool to
confront predictions from stellar nucleosynthesis with far more complex
abundance data sets and to refine the physical processes governing the
chemical evolution of stellar systems.

	Abstract = {{<BR /> Aims: We present the Stagger-grid, a comprehensive grid of
time-dependent, three-dimensional (3D), hydrodynamic model atmospheres
for late-type stars with realistic treatment of radiative transfer,
covering a wide range in stellar parameters. This grid of 3D models is
intended for various applications besides studies of stellar convection
and atmospheres per se, including stellar parameter determination,
stellar spectroscopy and abundance analysis, asteroseismology,
calibration of stellar evolution models, interferometry, and extrasolar
planet search. In this introductory paper, we describe the methods we
applied for the computation of the grid and discuss the general
properties of the 3D models as well as of their temporal and spatial
averages (here denoted {\mlab}3D{\mrab} models). <BR /> Methods: All our
models were generated with the Stagger-code, using realistic input
physics for the equation of state (EOS) and for continuous and line
opacities. Our \~{} 220 grid models range in effective temperature,
T$_{eff}$, from 4000 to 7000 K in steps of 500 K, in surface
gravity, log g, from 1.5 to 5.0 in steps of 0.5 dex, and metallicity,
[Fe/H], from - 4.0 to + 0.5 in steps of 0.5 and 1.0 dex. <BR /> Results:
We find a tight scaling relation between the vertical velocity and the
surface entropy jump, which itself correlates with the constant entropy
value of the adiabatic convection zone. The range in intensity contrast
is enhanced at lower metallicity. The granule size correlates closely
with the pressure scale height sampled at the depth of maximum velocity.
We compare the {\mlab}3D{\mrab} models with currently widely applied
one-dimensional (1D) atmosphere models, as well as with theoretical 1D
hydrostatic models generated with the same EOS and opacity tables as the
3D models, in order to isolate the effects of using self-consistent and
hydrodynamic modeling of convection, rather than the classical mixing
length theory approach. For the first time, we are able to quantify
systematically over a broad range of stellar parameters the
uncertainties of 1D models arising from the simplified treatment of
physics, in particular convective energy transport. In agreement with
previous findings, we find that the differences can be rather
significant, especially for metal-poor stars.

	Abstract = {In this brief communication we provide the rationale for and the outcome of the International Astronomical Union (IAU) resolution vote at the XXIXth General Assembly in Honolulu, Hawaii, in 2015, on recommended nominal conversion constants for selected solar and planetary properties. The problem addressed by the resolution is a lack of established conversion constants between solar and planetary values and SI units: a missing standard has caused a proliferation of solar values (e.g., solar radius, solar irradiance, solar luminosity, solar effective temperature, and solar mass parameter) in the literature, with cited solar values typically based on best estimates at the time of paper writing. As precision of observations increases, a set of consistent values becomes increasingly important. To address this, an IAU Working Group on Nominal Units for Stellar and Planetary Astronomy formed in 2011, uniting experts from the solar, stellar, planetary, exoplanetary, and fundamental astronomy, as well as from general standards fields to converge on optimal values for nominal conversion constants. The effort resulted in the IAU 2015 Resolution B3, passed at the IAU General Assembly by a large majority. The resolution recommends the use of nominal solar and planetary values, which are by definition exact and are expressed in SI units. These nominal values should be understood as conversion factors only, not as the true solar/planetary properties or current best estimates. Authors and journal editors are urged to join in using the standard values set forth by this resolution in future work and publications to help minimize further confusion.},

	Abstract = {{We present the first APOKASC catalog of spectroscopic and asteroseismic
properties of 1916 red giants observed in the Kepler fields. The
spectroscopic parameters provided from the Apache Point Observatory
Galactic Evolution Experiment project are complemented with
asteroseismic surface gravities, masses, radii, and mean densities
determined by members of the Kepler Asteroseismology Science Consortium.
We assess both random and systematic sources of error and include a
discussion of sample selection for giants in the Kepler fields. Total
uncertainties in the main catalog properties are of the order of 80 K in
T $_{eff}$, 0.06 dex in [M/H], 0.014 dex in log g, and 12\% and 5\%
in mass and radius, respectively; these reflect a combination of
systematic and random errors. Asteroseismic surface gravities are
substantially more precise and accurate than spectroscopic ones, and we
find good agreement between their mean values and the calibrated
spectroscopic surface gravities. There are, however, systematic
underlying trends with T $_{eff}$ and log g. Our effective
temperature scale is between 0 and 200 K cooler than that expected from
the infrared flux method, depending on the adopted extinction map, which
provides evidence for a lower value on average than that inferred for
the Kepler Input Catalog (KIC). We find a reasonable correspondence
between the photometric KIC and spectroscopic APOKASC metallicity
scales, with increased dispersion in KIC metallicities as the absolute
metal abundance decreases, and offsets in T $_{eff}$ and log g
consistent with those derived in the literature. We present mean fitting
relations between APOKASC and KIC observables and discuss future
prospects, strengths, and limitations of the catalog data.

@article{Smiljanic2014,
	Abstract = {{Context. The ongoing Gaia-ESO Public Spectroscopic Survey is using
FLAMES at the VLT to obtain high-quality medium-resolution Giraffe
spectra for about 10$^{5}$ stars and high-resolution UVES spectra
for about 5000 stars. With UVES, the Survey has already observed 1447
FGK-type stars. <BR /> Aims: These UVES spectra are analyzed in parallel
by several state-of-the-art methodologies. Our aim is to present how
these analyses were implemented, to discuss their results, and to
describe how a final recommended parameter scale is defined. We also
discuss the precision (method-to-method dispersion) and accuracy (biases
with respect to the reference values) of the final parameters. These
results are part of the Gaia-ESO second internal release and will be
part of its first public release of advanced data products. <BR />
Methods: The final parameter scale is tied to the scale defined by the
Gaia benchmark stars, a set of stars with fundamental atmospheric
parameters. In addition, a set of open and globular clusters is used to
evaluate the physical soundness of the results. Each of the implemented
methodologies is judged against the benchmark stars to define weights in
three different regions of the parameter space. The final recommended
results are the weighted medians of those from the individual methods.
<BR /> Results: The recommended results successfully reproduce the
atmospheric parameters of the benchmark stars and the expected
T$_{eff}$-log g relation of the calibrating clusters. Atmospheric
parameters and abundances have been determined for 1301 FGK-type stars
observed with UVES. The median of the method-to-method dispersion of the
atmospheric parameters is 55 K for T$_{eff}$, 0.13 dex for log g
and 0.07 dex for [Fe/H]. Systematic biases are estimated to be between
50-100 K for T$_{eff}$, 0.10-0.25 dex for log g and 0.05-0.10 dex
for [Fe/H]. Abundances for 24 elements were derived: C, N, O, Na, Mg,
Al, Si, Ca, Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Y, Zr, Mo, Ba, Nd,
and Eu. The typical method-to-method dispersion of the abundances varies
between 0.10 and 0.20 dex. <BR /> Conclusions: The Gaia-ESO sample of
high-resolution spectra of FGK-type stars will be among the largest of
its kind analyzed in a homogeneous way. The extensive list of elemental
abundances derived in these stars will enable significant advances in
the areas of stellar evolution and Milky Way formation and evolution.

	Abstract = {{<BR /> Aims: We have analyzed high-resolution and high
signal-to-noise-ratio optical spectra of nearby FGK stars with and
without detected giant planets in order to homogeneously measure their
photospheric parameters, mass, age, and the abundances of volatile (C,
N, and O) and refractory (Na, Mg, Si, Ca, Ti, V, Mn, Fe, Ni, Cu, and Ba)
elements. Our sample contains 309 stars from the solar neighborhood (up
to the distance of 100 pc), out of which 140 are dwarfs, 29 are
subgiants, and 140 are giants. <BR /> Methods: The photospheric
parameters are derived from the equivalent widths of Fe i and Fe ii
lines. Masses and ages come from the interpolation in evolutionary
tracks and isochrones on the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram. The abundance
determination is based on the equivalent widths of selected atomic lines
of the refractory elements and on the spectral synthesis of
C$_{2}$, CN, C i, O i, and Na i features. We apply a set of
statistical methods to analyze the abundances derived for the three
subsamples. <BR /> Results: Our results show that: i) giant stars
systematically exhibit underabundance in [C/Fe] and overabundance in
[N/Fe] and [Na/Fe] in comparison with dwarfs, a result that is normally
attributed to evolution-induced mixing processes in the envelope of
evolved stars; ii) for solar analogs alone, the abundance trends with
the condensation temperature of the elements are correlated with age and
anticorrelated with the surface gravity, which agrees with recent
studies; iii) as in the case of [Fe/H], dwarf stars with giant planets
are systematically enriched in [X/H] for all the analyzed elements,
except for O and Ba (the former due to limitations of statistics),
confirming previous findings in the literature that it is not only iron
that has an important relation with the planetary formation; and iv)
giant planet hosts are also significantly overabundant for the same
metallicity when the elements from Mg to Cu are combined.

	Abstract = {{Context. The rich open cluster M 67 is known to have a chemical
composition close to solar and an age of about 3.5-4.8 Gyr. It offers an
important opportunity to check and develop our understanding of the
physics and the evolution of solar-type stars. <BR /> Aims: We present a
spectroscopic study at high resolution, R {\ap} 50 000, of 14 stars
located on the main sequence, at the turn-off point, and on the early
subgiant branch in the cluster in order to investigate its detailed
chemical composition, for comparison with the Sun and solar twins in the
solar neighbourhood, and to explore selective atomic diffusion of
chemical elements as predicted by stellar-structure theory. <BR />
Methods: We have obtained VLT/FLAMES-UVES spectra and analysed these
strictly differentially in order to explore chemical-abundance
similarities and differences between the M 67 stars and the Sun and
among the M 67 stars themselves. <BR /> Results: Individual abundances
of 19 different chemical elements are obtained for the stars. They are
found to agree very well with solar abundances, with abundance ratios
closer to solar than those of most solar twins in the solar
neighbourhood. An exception is Li, which shows considerable scatter
among the cluster stars. There is a tendency for the cluster-star
abundances to be more depleted than the abundances in the field stars in
correlation with the condensation temperature of the elements, a
tendency also found earlier for the Sun. Moreover, the heavy-element
abundances are found to be reduced in the hotter stars and dwarfs by
typically {\le}0.05 dex, as compared to the abundances of the subgiants.
<BR /> Conclusions: The results support the hypothesis that the gas of
the proto-cluster was depleted by formation and cleansing of dust before
the stars formed. They also add support to the proposal that the Sun was
formed in a dense stellar environment. Moreover, the observed minor
reductions of heavy elements, relative to our standard star M 67-1194
and the subgiants, in the atmospheres of dwarfs and turn-off point stars
seem to suggest that diffusion processes are at work in these stars,
although the evidence is not compelling. Based on theoretical models,
the diffusion-corrected initial metallicity of M 67 is estimated to be
[Fe/H] = +0.06.

	Abstract = {{Studying the Milky Way disk structure using stars in narrow bins of
[Fe/H] and [{$\alpha$}/Fe] has recently been proposed as a powerful method
to understand the Galactic thick and thin disk formation. It has been
assumed so far that these mono-abundance populations (MAPs) are also
coeval, or mono-age, populations. Here we study this relationship for a
Milky Way chemodynamical model and show that equivalence between MAPs
and mono-age populations exists only for the high-[{$\alpha$}/Fe] tail,
where the chemical evolution curves of different Galactic radii are far
apart. At lower [{$\alpha$}/Fe]-values an MAP is composed of stars with a
range in ages, even for small observational uncertainties and a small
MAP bin size. Due to the disk inside-out formation, for these MAPs
younger stars are typically located at larger radii, which results in
negative radial age gradients that can be as large as 2 Gyr
kpc$^{-1}$. Positive radial age gradients can result for
MAPs at the lowest [{$\alpha$}/Fe] and highest [Fe/H] end. Such variations
with age prevent the simple interpretation of observations for which
accurate ages are not available. Studying the variation with radius of
the stellar surface density and scale height in our model, we find good
agreement to recent analyses of the APOGEE red-clump (RC) sample when
1-4 Gyr old stars dominate (as expected for the RC). Our results
suggest that the APOGEE data are consistent with a Milky Way model for
which mono-age populations flare for all ages. We propose observational
tests for the validity of our predictions and argue that using accurate
age measurements, such as from asteroseismology, is crucial for putting
constraints on Galactic formation and evolution.

	Abstract = {{The spatial, kinematic, and elemental-abundance structure of the Milky
Way's stellar disk is complex, and has been difficult to dissect with
local spectroscopic or global photometric data. Here, we develop and
apply a rigorous density modeling approach for Galactic spectroscopic
surveys that enables investigation of the global spatial structure of
stellar sub-populations in narrow bins of [{$\alpha$}/Fe] and [Fe/H], using
23,767 G-type dwarfs from SDSS/SEGUE, which effectively sample 5 kpc
$\lt$ R $_{GC}$ $\lt$ 12 kpc and 0.3 kpc $\lt$\~{} |Z| $\lt$\~{} 3 kpc. We
fit models for the number density of each such ([{$\alpha$}/Fe] and [Fe/H])
mono-abundance component, properly accounting for the complex
spectroscopic SEGUE sampling of the underlying stellar population, as
well as for the metallicity and color distributions of the samples. We
find that each mono-abundance sub-population has a simple spatial
structure that can be described by a single exponential in both the
vertical and radial directions, with continuously increasing scale
heights ({\ap}200 pc to 1 kpc) and decreasing scale lengths ($\gt$4.5 kpc
to 2 kpc) for increasingly older sub-populations, as indicated by their
lower metallicities and [{$\alpha$}/Fe] enhancements. That the
abundance-selected sub-components with the largest scale heights have
the shortest scale lengths is in sharp contrast with purely geometric
``thick-thin disk'' decompositions. To the extent that [{$\alpha$}/Fe] is an
adequate proxy for age, our results directly show that older disk
sub-populations are more centrally concentrated, which implies
inside-out formation of galactic disks. The fact that the largest
scale-height sub-components are most centrally concentrated in the Milky
Way is an almost inevitable consequence of explaining the vertical
structure of the disk through internal evolution. Whether the simple
spatial structure of the mono-abundance sub-components and the striking
correlations between age, scale length, and scale height can be
plausibly explained by satellite accretion or other external heating
remains to be seen.

	Abstract = {{We use the OMEGA galactic chemical evolution code to investigate how the
assumptions used for the treatment of galactic inflows and outflows
impact numerical predictions. The goal is to determine how our capacity
to reproduce the chemical evolution trends of a galaxy is affected by
the choice of implementation used to include those physical processes.
In pursuit of this goal, we experiment with three different
prescriptions for galactic inflows and outflows and use OMEGA within a
Markov Chain Monte Carlo code to recover the set of input parameters
that best reproduces the chemical evolution of nine elements in the
dwarf spheroidal galaxy Sculptor. This provides a consistent framework
for comparing the best-fit solutions generated by our different models.
Despite their different degrees of intended physical realism, we found
that all three prescriptions can reproduce in an almost identical way
the stellar abundance trends observed in Sculptor. This result supports
the similar conclusions originally claimed by Romano {\amp} Starkenburg
for Sculptor. While the three models have the same capacity to fit the
data, the best values recovered for the parameters controlling the
number of SNe Ia and the strength of galactic outflows, are
substantially different and in fact mutually exclusive from one model to
another. For the purpose of understanding how a galaxy evolves, we
conclude that only reproducing the evolution of a limited number of
elements is insufficient and can lead to misleading conclusions. More
elements or additional constraints such as the Galaxy{\rsquo}s
star-formation efficiency and the gas fraction are needed in order to
break the degeneracy between the different modeling assumptions. Our
results show that the successes and failures of chemical evolution
models are predominantly driven by the input stellar yields, rather than
by the complexity of the Galaxy model itself. Simple models such as
OMEGA are therefore sufficient to test and validate stellar yields.

formation and evolution of the Galaxy. <BR /> Aims: We aim to trace the
chemical evolution of the Galactic disk through the inspection of the
[X/Fe]-age relations of 24 species from C to Eu. <BR /> Methods: Using
high-resolution and high signal-to-noise UVES spectra of nine solar
twins, we obtained precise estimates of stellar ages and chemical
abundances. These determinations have been integrated with additional
accurate age and abundance determinations from recent spectroscopic
studies of solar twins existing in the literature, comprising superb
abundances with 0.01 dex precision. Based on this data set, we outlined
the [X/Fe]-age relations over a time interval of 10 Gyr. <BR /> Results:
We present the [X/Fe] - age relations for 24 elements (C, O, Na, Mg, Al,
Si, S, K, Ca, Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Y, Ba, La, Ce, Nd, and
Eu). Each different class of elements showed a distinct evolution with
time that relies on the different characteristics, rates, and timescales
of the nucleosynthesis sites from which they are produced. The
{$\alpha$}-elements are characterized by a [X/Fe] decrease with time.
Strikingly, the opposite behavior is observed for Ca. The iron-peak
elements show an early [X/Fe] increase followed by a decrease towards
the youngest stars. The [X/Fe] for the n-capture elements decrease with
age. We also found that both [Mg/Y] and [Al/Y] are precise stellar
clocks, with [Al/Y] showing the steepest dependence on age. <BR />
Conclusions: Knowledge of the [X/Fe]-age relations is a gold mine from
which we can achieve a great understanding of the processes that
governed the formation and evolution of the Milky Way. Through the
reverse engineering of these relations we will be able to put strong
constraints on the nature of the stellar formation history, the SNe
rates, the stellar yields, and the variety of the SNe progenitors.

	Abstract = {{I describe the design, implementation, and usage of galpy, a python
package for galactic-dynamics calculations. At its core, galpy consists
of a general framework for representing galactic potentials both in
python and in C (for accelerated computations); galpy functions,
objects, and methods can generally take arbitrary combinations of these
as arguments. Numerical orbit integration is supported with a variety of
Runge-Kutta-type and symplectic integrators. For planar orbits,
integration of the phase-space volume is also possible. galpy supports
the calculation of action-angle coordinates and orbital frequencies for
a given phase-space point for general spherical potentials, using
state-of-the-art numerical approximations for axisymmetric potentials,
and making use of a recent general approximation for any static
potential. A number of different distribution functions (DFs) are also
included in the current release; currently, these consist of
two-dimensional axisymmetric and non-axisymmetric disk DFs, a
three-dimensional disk DF, and a DF framework for tidal streams. I
provide several examples to illustrate the use of the code. I present a
simple model for the Milky Way's gravitational potential consistent with
the latest observations. I also numerically calculate the Oort functions
for different tracer populations of stars and compare them to a new
analytical approximation. Additionally, I characterize the response of a
kinematically warm disk to an elliptical m = 2 perturbation in detail.
Overall, galpy consists of about 54,000 lines, including 23,000 lines of

	Abstract = {{Context. High-precision determinations of abundances of elements in the
atmospheres of the Sun and solar twin stars indicate that the Sun has an
unusually low ratio between refractory and volatile elements. This has
led to the suggestion that the relation between abundance ratios,
[X/Fe], and elemental condensation temperature, T$_{C}$, can be
used as a signature of the existence of terrestrial planets around a
star. <BR /> Aims: HARPS spectra with S/N {\gsim} 600 for 21 solar twin
stars in the solar neighborhood and the Sun (observed via reflected
light from asteroids) are used to determine very precise ({$\sigma$} \~{} 0.01
dex) differential abundances of elements in order to see how well [X/Fe]
is correlated with T$_{C}$ and other parameters such as stellar
age. <BR /> Methods: Abundances of C, O, Na, Mg, Al, Si, S, Ca, Ti, Cr,
Fe, Ni, Zn, and Y are derived from equivalent widths of weak and
medium-strong spectral lines using MARCS model atmospheres with
parameters determined from the excitation and ionization balance of Fe
lines. Non-LTE effects are considered and taken into account for some of
the elements. In addition, precise ({$\sigma$} {\lsim} 0.8 Gyr) stellar ages
are obtained by interpolating between Yonsei-Yale isochrones in the log
g - T$_{eff}$ diagram. <BR /> Results: It is confirmed that the
ratio between refractory and volatile elements is lower in the Sun than
in most of the solar twins (only one star has the same
[X/Fe]-T$_{C}$ distribution as the Sun), but for many stars, the
relation between [X/Fe] and T$_{C}$ is not well defined. For
several elements there is an astonishingly tight correlation between
[X/Fe] and stellar age with amplitudes up to \~{}0.20 dex over an age
interval of eight Gyr in contrast to the lack of correlation between
[Fe/H] and age. While [Mg/Fe] increases with age, the s-process element
yttrium shows the opposite behavior meaning that [Y/Mg] can be used as a
sensitive chronometer for Galactic evolution. The Na/Fe and Ni/Fe ratios
are not well correlated with stellar age, but define a tight Ni-Na
relation similar to that previously found for more metal-poor stars
albeit with a smaller amplitude. Furthermore, the C/O ratio evolves very
little with time, although [C/Fe] and [O/Fe] change by \~{}0.15 dex. <BR />
Conclusions: The dependence of [X/Fe] on stellar age and the [Ni/Fe]-
[Na/Fe] variations complicate the use of the [X/Fe]-T$_{C}$
relation as a possible signature for the existence of terrestrial
planets around stars. The age trends for the various abundance ratios
provide new constraints on supernovae yields and Galactic chemical
evolution, and the slow evolution of C/O for solar metallicity stars is
of interest for discussions of the composition of exoplanets.

	Abstract = {{<BR /> Aims: Previously [Y/Mg] has been proven to be an age indicator
for solar twins. Here, we investigate if this relation also holds for
helium-core-burning stars of solar metallicity. <BR /> Methods: High
resolution and high signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) spectroscopic data of
stars in the helium-core-burning phase have been obtained with the FIES
spectrograph on the NOT 2.56 m telescope and the HIRES spectrograph on
the Keck I 10 m telescope. They have been analyzed to determine the
chemical abundances of four open clusters with close to solar
metallicity; NGC 6811, NGC 6819, M 67 and NGC 188. The abundances are
derived from equivalent widths of spectral lines using ATLAS9 model
atmospheres with parameters determined from the excitation and
ionization balance of Fe lines. Results from asteroseismology and binary
studies were used as priors on the atmospheric parameters, where
especially the log g is determined to much higher precision than what is
possible with spectroscopy. <BR /> Results: It is confirmed that the
four open clusters are close to solar metallicity and they follow the
[Y/Mg] vs. age trend previously found for solar twins. <BR />
Conclusions: The [Y/Mg] vs. age clock also works for giant stars in the
helium-core burning phase, which vastly increases the possibilities to
estimate the age of stars not only in the solar neighborhood, but in
large parts of the Galaxy, due to the brighter nature of evolved stars
compared to dwarfs.

	Abstract = {{Several recent studies of solar twins in the solar neighbourhood have
shown a tight correlation between various elemental abundances and age,
in particular [Y/Mg]. If this relation is real and valid for other types
of stars as well as elsewhere in the Galaxy, it would provide a very
powerful tool to derive ages of stars without the need to resort to
determining their masses (evolutionary stage) very precisely. The method
would also likely work if the stellar parameters have relatively large
errors. The studies presented in the recent literature span a narrow
range of [Fe/H]. By studying a larger sample of solar neighbourhood
dwarfs with a much larger range of [Fe/H], we find that the relation
between [Y/Mg] and age depends on the [Fe/H] of the stars. Hence, it
appears that the [Y/Mg]-age relation is unique to solar analogues.

@article{Venn2004,
	Abstract = {{To compare the chemistries of stars in the Milky Way dwarf spheroidal
(dSph) satellite galaxies with stars in the Galaxy, we have compiled a
large sample of Galactic stellar abundances from the literature. When
kinematic information is available, we have assigned the stars to
standard Galactic components through Bayesian classification based on
Gaussian velocity ellipsoids. As found in previous studies, the
[{$\alpha$}/Fe] ratios of most stars in the dSph galaxies are generally
lower than similar metallicity Galactic stars in this extended sample.
Our kinematically selected stars confirm this for the Galactic halo,
thin-disk, and thick-disk components. There is marginal overlap in the
low [{$\alpha$}/Fe] ratios between dSph stars and Galactic halo stars on
extreme retrograde orbits (V$\lt$-420 km s$^{-1}$), but this is not
supported by other element ratios. Other element ratios compared in this
paper include r- and s-process abundances, where we find a significant
offset in the [Y/Fe] ratios, which results in a large overabundance in
[Ba/Y] in most dSph stars compared with Galactic stars. Thus, the
chemical signatures of most of the dSph stars are distinct from the
stars in each of the kinematic components of the Galaxy. This result
rules out continuous merging of low-mass galaxies similar to these dSph
satellites during the formation of the Galaxy. However, we do not rule
out very early merging of low-mass dwarf galaxies, since up to one-half
of the most metal-poor stars ([Fe/H]$\lt$=-1.8) have chemistries that are
in fair agreement with Galactic halo stars. We also do not rule out
merging with higher mass galaxies, although we note that the LMC and the
remnants of the Sgr dwarf galaxy are also chemically distinct from the
majority of the Galactic halo stars. Formation of the Galaxy's thick
disk by heating of an old thin disk during a merger is also not ruled
out; however, the Galaxy's thick disk itself cannot be comprised of the
remnants from a low-mass (dSph) dwarf galaxy, nor of a high-mass dwarf
galaxy like the LMC or Sgr, because of differences in chemistry.

The new and independent environments offered by the dSph galaxies also
allow us to examine fundamental assumptions related to the
nucleosynthesis of the elements. The metal-poor stars ([Fe/H]$\lt$=-1.8)
in the dSph galaxies appear to have lower [Ca/Fe] and [Ti/Fe] than
[Mg/Fe] ratios, unlike similar metallicity stars in the Galaxy.
Predictions from the {$\alpha$}-process ({$\alpha$}-rich freeze-out) would be
consistent with this result if there have been a lack of hypernovae in
dSph galaxies. The {$\alpha$}-process could also be responsible for the
very low Y abundances in the metal-poor stars in dSph's; since [La/Eu]
(and possibly [Ba/Eu]) are consistent with pure r-process results, the
low [Y/Eu] suggests a separate r-process site for this light
(first-peak) r-process element. We also discuss SNe II rates and yields
as other alternatives, however. In stars with higher metallicities
([Fe/H]$\gt$=-1.8), contributions from the s-process are expected; [(Y,
La, and Ba)/Eu] all rise as expected, and yet [Ba/Y] is still much
higher in the dSph stars than similar metallicity Galactic stars. This
result is consistent with s-process contributions from lower metallicity
AGB stars in dSph galaxies, and is in good agreement with the slower
chemical evolution expected in the low-mass dSph galaxies relative to
the Galaxy, such that the build-up of metals occurs over much longer
timescales. Future investigations of nucleosynthetic constraints (as
well as galaxy formation and evolution) will require an examination of
many stars within individual dwarf galaxies.

Finally, the Na-Ni trend reported in 1997 by Nissen {\amp} Schuster is
confirmed in Galactic halo stars, but we discuss this in terms of the
general nucleosynthesis of neutron-rich elements. We do not confirm that
the Na-Ni trend is related to the accretion of dSph galaxies in the
Galactic halo.

measured from VLT/UVES and NOT/FIES spectra with resolutions R{\sime} 55

Results: The halo stars fall into two populations, clearly separated in

is a facility-class optical spectrograph for the Anglo-Australian
Telescope (AAT). It is designed primarily for Galactic Archaeology, the
first major attempt to create a detailed understanding of galaxy
formation and evolution by studying the history of our own galaxy, the
Milky Way. The goal of the GALAH survey is to reconstruct the mass
assembly history of the Milky Way through a detailed chemical abundance
study of one million stars. The spectrograph is based at the AAT and is
fed by the existing 2dF robotic fiber positioning system. The
spectrograph uses volume phase holographic gratings to achieve a
spectral resolving power of 28,000 in standard mode and also provides a
high-resolution mode ranging between 40,000 and 50,000 using a slit
mask. The GALAH survey requires an SNR greater than 100 for a star
brightness of V=14 in an exposure time of one hour. The total spectral
coverage of the four channels is about 100 nm between 370 and 1000 nm
for up to 392 simultaneous targets within the 2-degree field of view.
HERMES has been commissioned over three runs, during bright time in
October, November, and December 2013, in parallel with the beginning of
the GALAH pilot survey, which started in November 2013. We present the
first-light results from the commissioning run and the beginning of the
GALAH survey, including performance results such as throughput and
resolution, as well as instrument reliability.

	Abstract = {{Model atmosphere analyses of echelle spectra of some fifty nearby F- and
G-type stars are presented. The sample is confined to the main-sequence,
turnoff and subgiant region, regardless of the metal abundance. On the
base of these data, spectroscopic parallaxes are calculated and compared
to the Hipparcos astrometry to explore the reliability of the derived
stellar parameters, notably the surface gravity and metal abundance
scale. The spectroscopic distance scale is found in good agreement with
the Hipparcos parallaxes and is characterized by a 5\% rms uncertainty.
The results suggest a precision in log g of \~{} 0.1 dex, and 0.05-0.10 dex
for the metallicity. There is also reasonable evidence for the
spectroscopic effective temperature scale to be free of systematic
errors; typical uncertainties are assessed to \~{} 80 K. The basic
spectroscopic parameters are supplemented by data for the
microturbulence velocities, the projected rotational velocities, stellar
radii and alpha -enhancement abundances, the latter represented by the
element magnesium. Stellar masses are also given, though many are
probably subject to small adjustments (typically 5\%) in forthcoming
analyses. The well-defined distance correlation is also demonstrated to
be an efficient means for an identification of spectroscopic binaries.
The results are discussed in terms of a spectroscopically established
distance scale, the sites of the stellar populations in the
[Mg/H]-[Fe/Mg] plane, a timescale for the Galactic thin disk, and the
potential of future T$_{eff}$-log g Kiel diagrams for a precise
determination of Galactic globular clusters ages. Based on observations

	Abstract = {{The Milky Way Galaxy has an age of about 13 billion years. Solar-type
stars evolve all the long way to the realm of degenerate objects on
essentially this time-scale. This, as well as the particular advantage
that the Sun offers through reliable differential spectroscopic
analyses, render these stars the ideal tracers for the fossil record of
our parent spiral. Astrophysics is a science that is known to be
notoriously plagued by selection effects. The present work - with a
major focus in this fourth contribution on model atmosphere analyses of
spectroscopic binaries and multiple star systems - aims at a
volume-complete sample of about 300 nearby F-, G-, and K-type stars that
particularly avoids any kinematical or chemical pre-selection from the
outset. It thereby provides an unbiased record of the local stellar
populations - the ancient thick disc and the much younger thin disc. On
this base, the detailed individual scrutiny of the long-lived stars of
both populations unveils the thick disc as a single-burst component with
a local normalization of no less than 20 per cent. This enormous
fraction, combined with its much larger scaleheight, implies a mass for
the thick disc that is comparable to that of the thin disc. On account
of its completely different mass-to-light ratio the thick disc thereby
becomes the dark side of the Milky Way, an ideal major source for
baryonic dark matter. This massive, ancient population consequently
challenges any gradual build-up scenario for our parent spiral. Even
more, on the supposition that the Galaxy is not unusual, the thick disc
- as it emerges from this unbiased spectroscopic work - particularly
challenges the hierarchical cold-dark-matter-dominated formation picture
for spiral galaxies in general.

@article{Fuhrmann2004,
	Abstract = {{High-resolution spectroscopic observations of about 150 nearby stars or
star systems are presented and discussed. The study of these and another
100 objects of the previous papers of this series implies that the
Galaxy became reality 13 or 14 Gyr ago with the implementation of a
massive, rotationally-supported population of thick-disk stars. The very
high star formation rate in that phase gave rise to a rapid metal
enrichment and an expulsion of gas in supernovae-driven Galactic winds,
but was followed by a star formation gap for no less than three billion
years at the Sun's galactocentric distance. In a second phase, then, the
thin disk - our ``familiar Milky Way'' - came on stage. Nowadays it
traces the bright side of the Galaxy, but it is also embedded in a huge
coffin of dead thick-disk stars that account for a large amount of
baryonic dark matter. As opposed to this, cold-dark-matter-dominated
cosmologies that suggest a more gradual hierarchical buildup through
mergers of minor structures, though popular, are a poor description for
the Milky Way Galaxy - and by inference many other spirals as well - if,
as the sample implies, the fossil records of its long-lived stars do not
stick to this paradigm. Apart from this general picture that emerges
with reference to the entire sample stars, a good deal of the present
work is however also concerned with detailed discussions of many
individual objects. Among the most interesting we mention the blue
straggler or merger candidates HD 165401 and HD 137763/HD 137778, the
likely accretion of a giant planet or brown dwarf on 59 Vir in its
recent history, and HD 63433 that proves to be a young solar analog at
$\backslash$tau{\tilde}200 Myr. Likewise, the secondary to HR 4867, formerly
suspected non-single from the Hipparcos astrometry, is directly
detectable in the high-resolution spectroscopic tracings, whereas the
visual binary $\backslash$chi Cet is instead at least triple, and presumably even
quadruple. With respect to the nearby young stars a complete account of
the Ursa Major Association is presented, and we provide as well plain
evidence for another, the ``Hercules-Lyra Association'', the likely
existence of which was only realized in recent years. On account of its
rotation, chemistry, and age we do confirm that the Sun is very typical
among its G-type neighbors; as to its kinematics, it appears however not
unlikely that the Sun's known low peculiar space velocity could indeed
be the cause for the weak paleontological record of mass extinctions and
major impact events on our parent planet during the most recent Galactic
plane passage of the solar system. Although the significance of this
correlation certainly remains a matter of debate for years to come, we
point in this context to the principal importance of the thick disk for
a complete census with respect to the local surface and volume
densities. Other important effects that can be ascribed to this dark
stellar population comprise (i) the observed plateau in the shape of the
luminosity function of the local FGK stars, (ii) a small though
systematic effect on the basic solar motion, (iii) a reassessment of the
term ``asymmetrical drift velocity'' for the remainder (i.e. the thin
disk) of the stellar objects, (iv) its ability to account for the bulk
of the recently discovered high-velocity blue white dwarfs, (v) its
major contribution to the Sun's {\tilde}220 km s$^{-1}$ rotational
velocity around the Galactic center, and (vi) the significant flattening
that it imposes on the Milky Way's rotation curve. Finally we note a
high multiplicity fraction in the small but volume-complete local sample
of stars of this ancient population. This in turn is highly suggestive
for a star formation scenario wherein the few existing single stellar
objects might only arise from either late mergers or the dynamical
ejection of former triple or higher level star systems.

	Abstract = { After the Big Bang, production of heavy elements in the early Universe takes place starting from the formation of the first stars, their evolution, and explosion. The first supernova explosions have strong dynamical, thermal, and chemical feedback on the formation of subsequent stars and evolution of galaxies. However, the nature of the Universe's first stars and supernova explosions has not been well clarified. The signature of the nucleosynthesis yields of the first stars can be seen in the elemental abundance patterns observed in extremely metal-poor stars. Interestingly, those patterns show some peculiarities relative to the solar abundance pattern, which should provide important clues to understanding the nature of early generations of stars. We thus review the recent results of the nucleosynthesis yields of mainly massive stars for a wide range of stellar masses, metallicities, and explosion energies. We also provide yields tables and examine how those yields are affected by some hydrodynamical effects during supernova explosions, namely, explosion energies from those of hypernovae to faint supernovae, mixing and fallback of processed materials, asphericity, etc. Those parameters in the supernova nucleosynthesis models are constrained from observational data of supernovae and metal-poor stars. Nucleosynthesis yields are then applied to the chemical evolution model of our Galaxy and other types of galaxies to discuss how the chemical enrichment process occurred during evolution. },

	Abstract = {{We present results for a suite of 14 three-dimensional, high-resolution
hydrodynamical simulations of delayed-detonation models of Type Ia
supernova (SN Ia) explosions. This model suite comprises the first set
of three-dimensional SN Ia simulations with detailed isotopic yield
information. As such, it may serve as a data base for Chandrasekhar-mass
delayed-detonation model nucleosynthetic yields and for deriving
synthetic observables such as spectra and light curves. We employ a
physically motivated, stochastic model based on turbulent velocity
fluctuations and fuel density to calculate in situ the
deflagration-to-detonation transition probabilities. To obtain different
strengths of the deflagration phase and thereby different degrees of
pre-expansion, we have chosen a sequence of initial models with 1, 3, 5,
10, 20, 40, 100, 150, 200, 300 and 1600 (two different realizations)
ignition kernels in a hydrostatic white dwarf with a central density of
2.9 {\times} 10$^{9}$ g cm$^{-3}$, as well as one high
central density (5.5 {\times} 10$^{9}$ g cm$^{-3}$) and one
low central density (1.0 {\times} 10$^{9}$ g cm$^{-3}$)
rendition of the 100 ignition kernel configuration. For each simulation,
we determined detailed nucleosynthetic yields by post-processing
10$^{6}$ tracer particles with a 384 nuclide reaction network. All
delayed-detonation models result in explosions unbinding the white
dwarf, producing a range of $^{56}$Ni masses from 0.32 to 1.11
M$_{&sun;}$. As a general trend, the models predict that the
stable neutron-rich iron-group isotopes are not found at the lowest
velocities, but rather at intermediate velocities ({\tilde}3000-10 000 km
s$^{-1}$) in a shell surrounding a $^{56}$Ni-rich core. The
models further predict relatively low-velocity oxygen and carbon, with
typical minimum velocities around 4000 and 10 000 km s$^{-1}$,
respectively.

	Abstract = {{Using the DR12 public release of APOGEE data, we show that the thin and
thick discs separate very well in the space defined by [{$\alpha$}/Fe],
[Fe/H] and [C/N]. Thick disc giants have both higher [C/N] and higher
[{$\alpha$}/Fe] than do thin disc stars with similar [Fe/H]. We deduce that
the thick disc is composed of lower mass stars than the thin disc.
Considering the fact that at a given metallicity there is a one-to-one
relation between stellar mass and age, we are then able to infer the
chronology of disc formation. Both the thick and the thin discs -
defined by [{$\alpha$}/Fe] - converge in their dependence on [C/N] and
[C+N/Fe] at [Fe/H]{\ap}-0.7. We conclude that (1) the majority of thick
disc stars formed earlier than did the thin disc stars, (2) the
formation histories of the thin and thick discs diverged early on, even
when the [Fe/H] abundances are similar and (3) that the star formation
rate in the thin disc has been lower than in the thick disc, at all
metallicities. Although these general conclusions remain robust, we also
show that current stellar evolution models cannot reproduce the observed
C/N ratios for thick disc stars. Unexpectedly, reduced or inhibited
canonical extra mixing is very common in field stars. While subject to
abundance calibration zero-point uncertainties, this implies a strong
dependence of non-canonical extra mixing along the red giant branch on
the initial composition of the star and in particular on the
{$\alpha$}-elemental abundance.

	Abstract = {{New spectroscopic surveys offer the promise of stellar parameters and
abundances ({\ldquo}stellar labels{\rdquo}) for hundreds of thousands of
stars; this poses a formidable spectral modeling challenge. In many
cases, there is a subset of reference objects for which the stellar
labels are known with high(er) fidelity. We take advantage of this with
The Cannon, a new data-driven approach for determining stellar labels
from spectroscopic data. The Cannon learns from the {\ldquo}known{\rdquo}
labels of reference stars how the continuum-normalized spectra depend on
these labels by fitting a flexible model at each wavelength; then, The
Cannon uses this model to derive labels for the remaining survey stars.
We illustrate The Cannon by training the model on only 542 stars in 19
clusters as reference objects, with $\{$T$\}$$_{{eff}$$\}$, $\{$log$\}$ g, and
[$\{$Fe$\}$/$\{$$\{$H$\}$$\}$] as the labels, and then applying it to the spectra of
55,000 stars from APOGEE DR10. The Cannon is very accurate. Its stellar
labels compare well to the stars for which APOGEE pipeline (ASPCAP)
labels are provided in DR10, with rms differences that are basically
identical to the stated ASPCAP uncertainties. Beyond the reference
labels, The Cannon makes no use of stellar models nor any line-list, but
needs a set of reference objects that span label-space. The Cannon
performs well at lower signal-to-noise, as it delivers comparably good
labels even at one-ninth the APOGEE observing time. We discuss the
limitations of The Cannon and its future potential, particularly, to
bring different spectroscopic surveys onto a consistent scale of stellar
labels.

	Abstract = {{We present the data reduction procedures being used by the GALactic
Archeology with Hermes (GALAH) survey, carried out with the HERMES
fibre-fed, multi-object spectrograph on the 3.9-m Anglo-Australian
Telescope. GALAH is a unique survey, targeting 1 million stars brighter
than magnitude V = 14 at a resolution of 28 000 with a goal to measure
the abundances of 29 elements. Such a large number of high-resolution
spectra necessitate the development of a reduction pipeline optimized
for speed, accuracy, and consistency. We outline the design and
structure of the IRAF-based reduction pipeline that we developed,
specifically for GALAH, to produce fully calibrated spectra aimed for
subsequent stellar atmospheric parameter estimation. The pipeline takes
advantage of existing IRAF routines and other readily available software
so as to be simple to maintain, testable, and reliable. A radial
velocity and stellar atmospheric parameter estimator code is also
presented, which is used for further data analysis and yields a useful
verification of the reduction quality. We have used this estimator to
quantify the data quality of GALAH for fibre cross-talk level ({\lsim}0.5
per cent) and scattered light ({\tilde}5 counts in a typical 20 min
exposure), resolution across the field, sky spectrum properties,
wavelength solution reliability (better than 1 km s$^{-1}$
accuracy), and radial velocity precision.

	Abstract = {{Context. Elements heavier than Li are produced in the interiors of
stars. However, for many elements the exact production sites and the
timescales on which they are dispersed into the interstellar medium are
unknown. Having a clear picture on the origins of the elements is
important for our ability to trace and understand the formation and
chemical evolution of the Milky Way and its stellar populations. <BR />
Aims: The aim of this study is to investigate the origin and evolution
of Sc, V, Mn, and Co for a homogeneous and statistically significant
sample of stars probing the different populations of the Milky Way, in
particular the thin and thick disks. <BR /> Methods: Using
high-resolution spectra obtained with the MIKE, FEROS, SOFIN, FIES,
UVES, and HARPS spectrographs, we determine Sc, V, Mn, and Co abundances
for a large sample of F and G dwarfs in the solar neighborhood. The
method is based on spectral synthesis and using one-dimensional,
plane-parallel, local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) model stellar
atmospheres calculated with the MARCS 2012 code. The non-LTE (NLTE)
corrections from the literature were applied to Mn and Co. <BR />
Results: We find that the abundance trends derived for Sc (594 stars), V
(466 stars), and Co (567 stars) are very similar to what has been
observed for the {$\alpha$}-elements in the thin and thick disks. On the
contrary, Mn (569 stars) is generally underabundant relative to the Sun
(i.e., [ Mn/Fe ] $\lt$ 0) for [ Fe/H ] $\lt$ 0. In addition, for Mn, when
NLTE corrections are applied, the trend changes and is almost flat over
the entire metallicity range of the stars in our sample (-2 {\lsim} [
Fe/H ] {\lsim} + 0.4). The [Sc/Fe]-[Fe/H] abundance trends show a small
separation between the thin and thick disks, while for V and Co they
completely overlap. For Mn there is a small difference in [Mn/Fe], but
only when NLTE corrections are used. Comparisons with Ti as a reference
element show flat trends for all the elements except for Mn that show
well separated [Mn/Ti]-[Ti/H] trends for the thin and thick disks. <BR
/> Conclusions: The elements Sc and V present trends compatible with
production from type II supernovae (SNII) events. In addition, Sc
clearly shows a metallicity dependence for [ Fe/H ] $\lt$ -1. Instead, Mn
is produced in SNII events for [ Fe/H ] {\lsim} -0.4 and then type Ia
supernovae start to produce Mn. Finally, Co appears to be produced
mainly in SNII with suggestion of enrichment from hypernovae at low
metallicities.

	Abstract = {{Context. Elements heavier than iron are produced through neutron-capture
processes in the different phases of stellar evolution. Asymptotic giant
branch (AGB) stars are believed to be mainly responsible for elements
that form through the slow neutron-capture process, while the elements
created in the rapid neutron-capture process have production sites that
are less understood. Knowledge of abundance ratios as functions of
metallicity can lead to insight into the origin and evolution of our
Galaxy and its stellar populations. <BR /> Aims: We aim to trace the
chemical evolution of the neutron-capture elements Sr, Zr, La, Ce, Nd,
Sm, and Eu in the Milky Way stellar disk. This will allow us to
constrain the formation sites of these elements, as well as to probe the
evolution of the Galactic thin and thick disks. <BR /> Methods: Using
spectra of high resolution (42 000 {\lsim} R {\lsim} 65 000) and high
signal-to-noise (S/N {\gsim} 200) obtained with the MIKE and the FEROS
spectrographs, we determine Sr, Zr, La, Ce, Nd, Sm, and Eu abundances
for a sample of 593 F and G dwarf stars in the solar neighborhood. The
abundance analysis is based on spectral synthesis using one-dimensional,
plane-parallel, local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) model stellar
atmospheres calculated with the MARCS 2012 code. <BR /> Results: We
present abundance results for Sr (156 stars), Zr (311 stars), La (242
stars), Ce (365 stars), Nd (395 stars), Sm (280 stars), and Eu (378
stars). We find that Nd, Sm, and Eu show trends similar to what is
observed for the {$\alpha$} elements in the [X/Fe]-[Fe/H] abundance plane.
For [Sr/Fe] and [Zr/Fe], we find decreasing abundance ratios for
increasing metallicity, reaching sub-solar values at super-solar
metallicities. [La/Fe] and [Ce/Fe] do not show any clear trend with
metallicity, and they are close to solar values at all [Fe/H]. The
trends of abundance ratios [X/Fe] as a function of stellar ages present
different slopes before and after 8 Gyr. <BR /> Conclusions: The rapid
neutron-capture process is active early in the Galaxy, mainly in type-II
supernovae from stars in the mass range 8-10 M$_{&sun;}$. Europium
is almost completely produced by the r-process, but Nd and Sm show
similar trends to Eu even if their s-process component is higher.
Strontium and Zr are thought to be mainly produced by the s-process, but
show significant enrichment at low metallicity that requires extra
r-process production, which probably is different from the classical
r-process. Finally, La and Ce are mainly produced via s-process from AGB
stars in the mass range 2-4 M$_{&sun;}$, which can be seen by the
decrease in [La/Eu] and [Ce/Eu] at [Fe/H] {\ap} -0.5. The trend of [X/Fe]
with age could be explained by considering that the decrease in [X/Fe]
for the thick disk stars can be due to the decrease in type-II
supernovae with time, meaning a reduced enrichment of r-process elements
in the interstellar medium. In the thin disk, the trends are flatter,
which is probably due to the main production from the s-process being
balanced by Fe production from type-Ia supernovae.

	Abstract = {{Galah is an ongoing high-resolution spectroscopic survey with the goal
of disentangling the formation history of the Milky Way using the fossil
remnants of disrupted star formation sites that are now dispersed around
the Galaxy. It is targeting a randomly selected magnitude-limited (V
{\le} 14) sample of stars, with the goal of observing one million
objects. To date, 300,000 spectra have been obtained. Not all of them
are correctly processed by parameter estimation pipelines, and we need
to know about them. We present a semi-automated classification scheme
that identifies different types of peculiar spectral morphologies in an
effort to discover and flag potentially problematic spectra and thus
help to preserve the integrity of the survey results. To this end, we
employ the recently developed dimensionality reduction technique t-SNE
(t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding), which enables us to
represent the complex spectral morphology in a two-dimensional
projection map while still preserving the properties of the local
neighborhoods of spectra. We find that the majority (178,483) of the
209,533 Galah spectra considered in this study represents normal single
stars, whereas 31,050 peculiar and problematic spectra with very diverse
spectral features pertaining to 28,579 stars are distributed into 10
classification categories: hot stars, cool metal-poor giants, molecular
absorption bands, binary stars, H{$\alpha$}/H{$\beta$} emission,
H{$\alpha$}/H{$\beta$} emission superimposed on absorption, H{$\alpha$}/H{$\beta$}
P-Cygni, H{$\alpha$}/H{$\beta$} inverted P-Cygni, lithium absorption, and
problematic. Classified spectra with supplementary information are
presented in the catalog, indicating candidates for follow-up
observations and population studies of the short-lived phases of stellar
evolution.

	Abstract = {{Context. In the current era of large spectroscopic surveys of the Milky
Way, reference stars for calibrating astrophysical parameters and
chemical abundances are of paramount importance. <BR /> Aims: We
determine elemental abundances of Mg, Si, Ca, Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Co, and
Ni for our predefined set of Gaia FGK benchmark stars. <BR /> Methods:
By analysing high-resolution spectra with a high signal-to-noise ratio
taken from several archive datasets, we combined results of eight
different methods to determine abundances on a line-by-line basis. We
performed a detailed homogeneous analysis of the systematic
uncertainties, such as differential versus absolute abundance analysis.
We also assessed errors that are due to non-local thermal equilibrium
and the stellar parameters in our final abundances. <BR /> Results: Our
results are provided by listing final abundances and the different
sources of uncertainties, as well as line-by-line and method-by-method
abundances. <BR /> Conclusions: The atmospheric parameters of the Gaia
FGK benchmark stars are already being widely used for calibration of
several pipelines that are applied to different surveys. With the added
reference abundances of ten elements, this set is very suitable for
calibrating the chemical abundances obtained by these pipelines.

@article{Fuhrmann2011,
	Abstract = {{This fifth in a series of papers finishes the model atmosphere analyses
of an unbiased, volume-complete sample of more than 300 nearby
solar-type stars. The sample first disintegrates into thick-disc and
thin-disc stars on account of their different distributions in the
[Mg/H]-[Fe/Mg] chemical abundance plane. Detailed stellar age-datings of
the locally few, but very relevant, subgiants show this map to be the
sequel of a major star formation gap and hence the legacy for the two
stellar populations. Among the stars of the thin disc the subgiant 70
Vir with {$\tau$}= 8.1 {\plusmn} 0.6 Gyr remains the best case to constrain
the age of this comparatively young population. Uncertainties for the
existing thick-disc subgiants are about twice as much, but they
consistently promote ages of 12-13 Gyr. The unbiased thin-disc
metallicity distribution functions of magnesium and iron average at
$\lt$[Mg/H]$\gt$=-0.009 {\plusmn} 0.012 dex and $\lt$[Fe/H]$\gt$=-0.034
{\plusmn} 0.015 dex, thereby demonstrating that the Sun is a typical
thin-disc star in terms of these two elements. The small but likewise
unbiased sample of thick-disc stars leads to $\lt$[Mg/H]$\gt$=-0.207
{\plusmn} 0.049 dex and $\lt$[Fe/H]$\gt$=-0.584 {\plusmn} 0.057 dex, which
implies that about two-thirds of the {$\alpha$}-element magnesium was
already synthesized in the early Milky Way. Similarly, the
age-metallicity relations for the thin disc result in
{$\Delta$}[Mg/H]=+0.006 dex Gyr$^{-1}$ and {$\Delta$}[Fe/H]=+0.017 dex
Gyr$^{-1}$ and lead to the conclusion that a similar percentage of
iron was synthesized before the birth of the thin disc. In comparison
with the considerable metallicity dispersions {$\sigma$}$_{[Mg/H]}$=
0.151 dex and {$\sigma$}$_{[Fe/H]}$= 0.191 dex for the stars of the
thin disc, this immediately explains the coexistence of old, metal rich
as well as young, fairly metal poor stars within this stellar
population. The stellar multiplicities of the solar-type thin-disc stars
show a minority of less than 47 per cent to be single and at least 15
per cent to belong to triple and higher level systems. More concisely,
in terms of the primary masses there is a clear correlation with mass
with a cross-over of preferentially single to binary stars at M{\sime}
1.25 M$_{&sun;}$ and a fraction of 21 per cent of triple and
higher level systems at this particular mass. The steady record of new
discoveries of nearby companion stars renders these numbers, however, as
yet provisional, with an ever-decreasing fraction of single objects. For
the thick disc the multiplicity statistics are necessarily weak, yet
tentatively imply even less single stars and eventually more triple or
higher level systems. Most importantly, and as already addressed in the
previous papers of this series, the rigorous census of the long-lived
stars of the sample uncovers the thick disc as a massive, dark
population with a 20 per cent local normalization, and, on account of
its larger scaleheight, a mass comparable to that of the thin disc. With
the ages of its stars at or above 12 Gyr the thick-disc epoch then leads
to a very different star formation rate and qualifies this stellar
population as a single-burst component, much at variance with the thin
disc whose stars cover the complete stellar age range of 1 Myr up to 8
Gyr. Such information conveyed by the stars of the solar neighbourhood
then clearly do not support a gradual build-up scenario, a hierarchical
cold-dark-matter-dominated formation picture for our parent spiral.
Provided the Milky Way is not an unusual spiral galaxy, it implies that
this paradigm is also challenged in a much broader context.

it falls in the sparsely populated {\ldquo}green valley{\rdquo} region of

structural and kinematic parameters of the Galaxy, and point to
uncertainties as well as directions for future progress. Galactic
studies will continue to play a fundamental role far into the future

@article{Haywood2013,
	Abstract = {{We analyze a sample of solar neighborhood stars that have high-quality
abundance determinations and show that there are two distinct regimes of
[{$\alpha$}/Fe] versus age, which we identify as the epochs of the thick
and thin disk formation. A tight correlation between metallicity and
[{$\alpha$}/Fe] versus age is clearly identifiable for thick disk stars,
implying that this population formed from a well mixed interstellar
medium, probably initially in starburst and then more quiescently, over
a time scale of 4-5 Gyr. Thick disk stars have vertical velocity
dispersions which correlate with age, with the youngest objects of this
population having small scale heights similar to those of thin disk
stars. A natural consequence of these two results is that a vertical
metallicity gradient is expected in this population. We suggest that the
youngest thick disk set the initial conditions from which the inner thin
disk started to form about 8 Gyr ago, at [Fe/H] in the range of (-0.1,
+0.1) dex and [{$\alpha$}/Fe] \~{} 0.1 dex. This also provides an explanation
for the apparent coincidence between the existence of a step in
metallicity at 7-10 kpc in the thin disk and the confinement of the
thick disk within R $\lt$ 10 kpc. We suggest that the outer thin disk
developed outside the influence of the thick disk, giving rise to a
separate structure, but also that the high alpha-enrichment of those
regions may originate from a primordial pollution of the outer regions
by the gas expelled from the forming thick disk. Metal-poor thin disk
stars ([Fe/H] $\lt$ -0.4 dex) in the solar vicinity, whose properties are
best explained by them originating in the outer disk, are shown to be as
old as the youngest thick disk (9-10 Gyr). This implies that the outer
thin disk started to form while the thick disk was still forming stars
in the inner parts of the Galaxy. Hence, while the overall inner
(thick+thin) disk is comprised of two structures with different scale
lengths and whose combination may give the impression of an inside-out
formation process, the thin disk itself probably formed its first stars
in its outskirts. Moreover, we point out that, given the tight
age-metallicity and age-[{$\alpha$}/Fe] relations that exist in the thick
disk, an inside-out process would give rise to a radial gradient in
metallicity and {$\alpha$}-elements in this population, which is not
observed. Finally, we argue that our results leave little room for
radial migration (in the sense of churning) either to have contaminated
the solar vicinity, or, on a larger scale, to have redistributed stars
in significant proportion across the solar annulus.

	Abstract = {{Context. We performed a uniform and detailed abundance analysis of 12
refractory elements (Na, Mg, Al, Si, Ca, Ti, Cr, Ni, Co, Sc, Mn, and V)
for a sample of 1111 FGK dwarf stars from the HARPS GTO planet search
program. Of these stars, 109 are known to harbor giant planetary
companions and 26 stars are exclusively hosting Neptunians and
super-Earths. <BR /> Aims: The two main goals of this paper are to
investigate whether there are any differences between the elemental
abundance trends for stars of different stellar populations and to
characterize the planet host and non-host samples in terms of their
[X/H]. The extensive study of this sample, focused on the abundance
differences between stars with and without planets will be presented in
a parallel paper. <BR /> Methods: The equivalent widths of spectral
lines were automatically measured from HARPS spectra with the ARES code.
The abundances of the chemical elements were determined using an LTE
abundance analysis relative to the Sun, with the 2010 revised version of
the spectral synthesis code MOOG and a grid of Kurucz ATLAS9
atmospheres. To separate the Galactic stellar populations we applied
both a purely kinematical approach and a chemical method. <BR />
Results: We found that the chemically separated (based on the Mg, Si,
and Ti abundances) thin- and thick disks are also chemically disjunct
for Al, Sc, Co, and Ca. Some bifurcation might also exist for Na, V, Ni,
and Mn, but there is no clear boundary of their [X/Fe] ratios. We
confirm that an overabundance in giant-planet host stars is clear for
all studied elements.We also confirm that stars hosting only
Neptunian-like planets may be easier to detect around stars with similar
metallicities than around non-planet hosts, although for some elements
(particulary {$\alpha$}-elements) the lower limit of [X/H] is very abrupt.

	Abstract = {{We develop a chemical evolution model to study the star formation
history of the Milky Way. Our model assumes that the Milky Way has
formed from a closed-box-like system in the inner regions, while the
outer parts of the disc have experienced some accretion. Unlike the
usual procedure, we do not fix the star formation prescription (e.g.
Kennicutt law) to reproduce the chemical abundance trends. Instead, we
fit the abundance trends with age to recover the star formation history
of the Galaxy. Our method enables us to recover the star formation
history of the Milky Way in the first Gyrs with unprecedented accuracy
in the inner (R $\lt$ 7-8 kpc) and outer (R $\gt$ 9-10 kpc) discs, as
sampled in the solar vicinity. We show that half the stellar mass formed
during the thick-disc phase in the inner galaxy during the first 4-5
Gyr. This phase was followed by a significant dip in star formation
activity (at 8-9 Gyr) and a period of roughly constant lower-level star
formation for the remaining 8 Gyr. The thick-disc phase has produced as
many metals in 4 Gyr as the thin-disc phase in the remaining 8 Gyr. Our
results suggest that a closed-box model is able to fit all the available
constraints in the inner disc. A closed-box system is qualitatively
equivalent to a regime where the accretion rate maintains a high gas
fraction in the inner disc at high redshift. In these conditions the SFR
is mainly governed by the high turbulence of the interstellar medium. By
z \~{} 1 it is possible that most of the accretion takes place in the outer
disc, while the star formation activity in the inner disc is mostly
sustained by the gas that is not consumed during the thick-disc phase
and the continuous ejecta from earlier generations of stars. The outer
disc follows a star formation history very similar to that of the inner
disc, although initiated at z \~{} 2, about 2 Gyr before the onset of the
thin-disc formation in the inner disc.

@article{Hayden2015,
	Abstract = {{Using a sample of 69,919 red giants from the SDSS-III/APOGEE Data
Release 12, we measure the distribution of stars in the [{$\alpha$}/Fe]
versus [Fe/H] plane and the metallicity distribution functions (MDFs)
across an unprecedented volume of the Milky Way disk, with radius 3 $\lt$
R $\lt$ 15 kpc and height | z| $\backslash$lt 2 kpc. Stars in the inner disk (R $\lt$
5 kpc) lie along a single track in [{$\alpha$}/Fe] versus [Fe/H], starting
with {$\alpha$}-enhanced, metal-poor stars and ending at [{$\alpha$}/Fe] {\tilde}
0 and [Fe/H] {\tilde} +0.4. At larger radii we find two distinct sequences
in [{$\alpha$}/Fe] versus [Fe/H] space, with a roughly solar-{$\alpha$}
sequence that spans a decade in metallicity and a high-{$\alpha$} sequence
that merges with the low-{$\alpha$} sequence at super-solar [Fe/H]. The
location of the high-{$\alpha$} sequence is nearly constant across the disk
however, there are very few high-{$\alpha$} stars at R $\gt$ 11 kpc. The
peak of the midplane MDF shifts to lower metallicity at larger R,
reflecting the Galactic metallicity gradient. Most strikingly, the shape
of the midplane MDF changes systematically with radius, from a
negatively skewed distribution at 3 $\lt$ R $\lt$ 7 kpc, to a roughly
Gaussian distribution at the solar annulus, to a positively skewed shape
in the outer Galaxy. For stars with | z| $\backslash$gt 1 kpc or [{$\alpha$}/Fe] $\gt$
0.18, the MDF shows little dependence on R. The positive skewness of the
outer-disk MDF may be a signature of radial migration; we show that
blurring of stellar populations by orbital eccentricities is not enough
to explain the reversal of MDF shape, but a simple model of radial
migration can do so.
